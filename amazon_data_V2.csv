My problem with undershirts is that XL ones are almost always way too big, and the L ones aren\'t long enough.These ones are almost perfect. I would like an inch or a little less of extra length, but most of the time, I expect these to stay tucked in. They are also pretty soft, and seem to be made of a little thicker material than my other undershirts (Hanes and the older L Gildan ones that I mentioned).', ""Bought the Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack, Style G1100 in size Medium and was pleasantly surprised with the product. When reading reviews I found it helpful when others provided actual weight and height.  The product was bought for a slender teen about 116 pounds and 5ft 8in. The M worked perfect for the way he likes clothing to fit. We followed the washing instructions and have washed them twice and dried in the dryer on the air dry cycle for delicate clothing. They held their shape and color. The lighting is terrible in the pictures so it doesn’t do the shirt justice. Super soft, very comfortable, tag-less is a plus, and length is phenomenal. They are thin but these colors were only see through if you held them up to a light source. My teen does not like the fitted look so we bought the medium. If you are looking for a well fitted shirt get your actual size based off the size guide. Based off these last comments, the item did not get a 5 star review.  This is picking at straws to get a well thought out review and it really is all about preferences. Perfect for layering and warm weather. Really can’t beat the price for the quality."", 'I had low expectations as cause every t shirt seems to just suck but this one fit exactly as I hoped it would. That being said I washed them then dried them on low heat ( I do this with all cheap t shirts anyway as they seem to always have a weird long fit out of the box ) They are high up the arm and fit tightly around the chest an waist but not to tight to where they are uncomfortable. For reference I’m lean but with slightly broader shoulders and I’d say “athletic arms”I’ll update this review in a month or so if the shirts randomly become unwearable which happens to be the theme with cheap clothing but as of right now these are going to be my go to “ plain shirts “ if nothing changes. Hope this helped', ""These are fine.  They're what you expect.  If you're getting them because you're hoping for super soft shirts for cuddle-times and sleep, as I was?

Good thick fabric, 100% cotton (but low thread count feel), will shrink, NOT tagless but tag rips off easily.For this price point, there is no point in complaining as if you paid more so here are some things to expect:It’s 100% cotton so it’s going to shrink since it’s not “pre-shrunk”It’s possible these are “fake” as many claim, or it may be Hanes cutting back on quality control. There is no way to knowing one way or another but here are some observations.Got 3 packs and 1 shirt had a hole in the back already.Shirts will NOT arrive in Factory branded bags, they’ll be in generic sealed plastic bags (my guess is because its easier for “try before you buy returns” to be folded/packaged/resealed for the next buyer) so wash before wearing.This is NOT tagless, but the tag does tear off easily. This doesn’t PROVE these are fake of knock offs (Maybe Hanes has a large stockpile of tags they can sew on for the cost of nothing instead of spending on the special ink, running the machinery and employees trained to operate said machinery to get that tagless. Idk.These are most likely 100% cotton as claimed so they WILL shrink! I find the larger the shirt size the more they will shrink relative to their size. So plan accordingly.A common complaint is that they’re itchy. All I can say is WASH BEFORE WEARING as you should be anyways. Ever heard of demodex mites? Now you have.Another complaint is that they feel rough. this isn’t 3000 thread count Egyptian cotton feeling more like 300 thread count. With that said these are FAR thicker than the genuine Hanes shirts I’ve bought in store in the last few years. Personally, I’ve never noticed.Bottom line: If you are the type of guy who may not even own a pair of cargo pants (anymore) but loved them because of its functionality. Who knows what SAE/metric is, and doesn’t wear tight jeans (by choice).Chances are very high you’ll be happy with these.$2.50/shirt + tax', ""I'm top heavy which makes it hard to find tshirts that fit how I want them to.

The thickness also provides a better form fit under your top layers [not sticking to those unflattering curves for us non-super models] and helps to create a sold shapely base for the top layers.3] Still TBA but so far I believe these will hold up longer than versions advertised as undershirts which are so thin the stain easy, wrinkle, and provide no shape.

And I don't have to drive 50 miles to the Outlet store.2. I buy the same clothes over and over.  Always the same sizes and colors for the basic items. a. I buy Champion long boxer briefs, preferably made in Vietnam. b. I buy sock from Johnston and Murphy. c. I buy t-Shirts (and most other items) from Brooks Brothers Outlet.Unfortunately, Johnston and Murphy's over the calf blue merino wool socks change over the year.  Double pipes at first, then single pipes close together, then triple pipes.  All I want is the same exact blue sock and same exact grey sock year after year so that I can avoid matching socks out of the clean clothes basket.  No, what should be the same exact sock is a big mix and match event every morning.  Same thing with Champion.  Why do I have to check to see what country they are made in before buying them.  Why can't I just trust that Champion underwear are the same the world over.3. I like high quality.  Here is how I define quality: a. Don't skimp on material. b. Long staple threads. c. Ergonomically cut.Every single sock manufacturer out there is skimping on material on socks.  Johnston and Murphy, Brooks Brothers, all shorter as the years go by.  They make them a quarter of an inch shorter.  It doesn't sound like a lot.  But I have to keep pulling up my new socks.  I never have to pull up my old socks.  How much money is being saved by cutting the socks a quarter inch shorter?Brooks Brothers t-shirts are still pretty good.  I have stuck with Brooks Brothers because every other t-shirt manufacturer that I've tried makes them an inch shorter, which means they come untucked.  Brooks Brothers t-shirts always stay tucked in.  And they don't pill after 10 washes.  I hate pilled t-shirts.  I hate them!Ergonomically cut: my mother bought me some gold toe socks.  I have big calves.  The elastic cut into my calves by the end of the day.  Five year old Johnston and Murphy socks are butter smooth.  The new ones are starting to cut with a sharp rigid thread around the top.  Brooks Brothers has a nice soft elastic at the top--if you buy the non-outlet variety--which go for $25 - $50 per pair.  That's a lot of money for socks when I like to keep 15 pair of blue and 15 pair of grey in the drawer after a full wash.  That would be like $750 - $1,500 for socks.  But the ergonomics on a sock make the difference between a beautiful day and a day that makes you feel like you've been sweating out in the sun.So, here is the scoop on the Amazon Essentials t-Shirts:1. Value: They are $16 for 6 shirt.  So, that's about $32 per year that I would spend on t-shirts.  That's Awesome!2. Consistency: Amazon gets it!  They actually advertises that they are not going to keep switching up.  You get the same thing every time.  I'm sure they will find a better way to make something and that a change will occur every now and then.  That's fine if they make an improvement.  But I'm betting it will not be changing the number of pipes running down my socks.  I'm sure other brands change the number of pipes because they found a factory in one country that makes they cheaper than in another country.  And they are not made to Johnston and Murphy's specs.  They are just  socks already being produced by another manufacturer at a lower cost than the last factory.3. Ergonomics: The t-shirts fit well.  From what I can tell so far, Amazon Essentials t-shirts use long staple cotton that will not pill.But all of this is really to communicate to Amazon.  Nice job with Amazon Essentials!  Would you *please* make some over-the-calf dress socks.  I will love you even more than I already do.  Please consider making long inseam boxer briefs that somehow keep the legs from riding up or don't start slipping down.  Also, I wear a lot of all cotton, non-iron dress shirts.  All cotton, non-iron, pleated, chino's would be awesome.  Long rise, gaberdine dress slacks would be great!  But, maybe I'm getting beyond the essentials with the slacks.  But please, the socks!

These aren’t quite as popular but they should be, they are better made and about the same price per shirt if you buy the multipacks with five shirts in them. And the biggest thing they have going for them is the incredible choice of colors, although I would suggest to them that they should try to stay away from including so many of the dull dark colors, today’s active man doesn’t dress like his grandfather, bright colors are very popular now.The material isn’t like most casual tee shirts, it is a shiny slick manmade material that on close inspection looks like it is knit like a very thin sweater.WHAT I LIKETopping the list of likes are the great bright colors that stay bright wash after wash. They don’t shrink either and they are true to U.S. men’s sizes.  That makes them easy to buy.  They feel great and don’t show wrinkles.NOT SO POSITIVEThere is nothing that I dislike about these but there are a few things you should know. One is that they are fairly thin.

These are one of the best values around.', ""I was drawn to these because they are inexpensive and I wanted something plain for the gym.

Comfy, and i like how they have no tag.', ""The quality and feel of the shirts is great, but they have one drawback which may bother some people (and certainly bothers me quite a lot). There is no tag or print on the inside back neckline of the shirt where you could easily see if it's the front or back, and the collar of the shirt is as such that front and back looks almost identical when you're holding it, and so oftentimes I end up putting it on backwards, have to take it back off, and put it on the right way. They really should have either made a tag on the back neckline of the shirt or some printing on it, as most shirts have. This wouldn't have been an issue as much with a v-neck shirt, but with this one it can get quite frustrating. Aside from that, it's a great shirt."", 'Good for the gym but very light material.

It still had the smell after washing.  Used Downy wrinkle release spray on it after the laundry not getting rid of the odor since it also contains odor neutralizer components, and let it air out for another 2 days - finally, the odor was gone.  Best way to describe the odor was like a chemical version of extremely bad BO.  I own many UA clothing, including other compression shirts and never had that chemical smell in any other than 1 which aired out and lost the odor in a day.Had also purchased another UA compression shirt at the same time as this one (different model, not the same neck cut) - it has a different thickness and feel to it and didn't have an odor upon arrival.  Both feel great, but prefer the comfort and fit of this one over the other and even over any of my other UA and other branded compression shirts.*Synopsis:- Shirt arrived with a bad chemical odor.Solution:  Wash with laundry (it may still have the smell after washing), then use *Downy Wrinkle Release Spray* (also includes odor neutralizing ingredients) and air it out for a day.  Using the spray after the wash worked perfectly and eliminated the odor 100%.- It fits great and feels extremely comfortable!"", 'I\'ve tried S, M, LG, and X-LG in an attempt to make this shirt work for me, without success. It might, however work for you.I\'m a fairly exothermic guy and always prefer these sorts of shirts to baggier t-shirts, buttons downs, pull-overs and the like. I always go for heat gear because unless I am going to be standing around in sub-15F temperatures, anything heavier just makes me too hot.I also wear these shirts everywhere - to work, to bed, around the house, out hiking, out to restaurants, everywhere, so I can\'t have anything that is too formfitting. I\'m in very good shape, but if feels obnoxious wandering around in something that fits like a second skin. That and it is just uncomfortable for me.What I wanted was something like I currently have - a lightweight, fitted synthetic shirt  that is well-made with no or minimally visible logos. Nothing baggy. Nothing skin-tight. These seemed like a perfect match - UA is a good brand, these have no logos at all, and while they are compression shirts I figured I would just buy up one size.Turns out this doesn\'t really work. These shirts are intended to be compression shirts, which means they only really work (move with the body and offload heat) when they are compressing the skin. The material is actually fairly thick before it is stretched out. Buying up a size resulted in a shirt that just ill-fitting, having extra material all over the place and still being too hot, since now the air couldn\'t circulate properly through the material. That said, this issue aside the material is quite comfortable against the skin and seems to be high quality.Fit-wise: I am a 5\'10"" male with an athletic build, ~185 with a <10% BMI. So very fit, but not ""swole"" in any way. I tried the small, medium, large, and extra large. S was way too tight - getting it off was tougher than getting it on and getting it on wasn\'t exactly a picnic. M was pretty good, but since I didn\'t want something form-fitting, I tried L and XL. The L had the general look I wanted, whereas the XL, while still being surprisingly tight, had way too much extra material. However, even the L was too hot during normal day-to-day activities, let alone while running or working outside. The M, L, and XL were all heavier by about 20% than my current shirts (black Reebocks, which I would buy again but the model is discontinued).So if you want compression and something skin-tight, my recommendation for someone my size is M or, if you have more muscle mass up top, maybe a LG. If you don\'t want compression, try a different shirt instead.EDIT: Worth noting that after a few washes, the shirts loosen up considerably. Enough that the XL is now a little baggy around the waist for me (for a compression shirt, anyway). As such, the L is probably the better way to go, once it is broken it, it should fit nicely.', ""I got these at a really great deal.  They were purchased mainly to make wearing my vest more comfortable.  They feel great and almost forget they are there.  Im normally a xl bit got an l for added compression.  Just be aware that these try before you buy items may show signs of use.  I washed the two last ones I got and forgot to take pictures of the deodorant streaks it came with before it was washed.  But I did post the picture of a torn bag sealed inside the resealed package I received.  This shouldn't stop you from purchasing this shirt.  It allows me to stay comfortable under kevlar and another shirt.""]"

I will definitely buy more of these, either in size L to accommodate my baby bump, or in S/M for after I lose the baby weight.Just be aware that because it’s so soft, it does nothing at all to hide your nips. My husband loved how the XL felt, but vetoed it as soon as he looked at himself in the mirror (I assume an undershirt would fix this, but then it kind of defeats the purpose of buying a soft, comfy tee).

In other words, you'll often think the shirt is perfect for printing, nice and clean - bright white. Once under heat (no its not my press or equipment), the 5280's often reveal imperfections that create spots or dark areas - ruining the product for sale.

The Dark Indigo Feeder Stripe was just plain ugly and reminded me of something out of 1965, so we returned that right off.  The other 3 we exchanged for an extra large... the fit was loose and perfect.  The Dark Indigo Triple Stripe was my favorite and looks very youthful and vibrant... cousin liked it the least as he said it was more suitable for someone much younger. He's probably right, but his wife loved it, so it's a keeper!  They all look great with his new jeans and khaki's.When you get the right fit, these really are good quality shirts.

It is a very good price (many other companies are charging an inflated price because of the high demand and some people just want a certain name brand).

My only critique is it is a little small in my opinion (it still fits ok, but I like something with extra room to wear another thermal shirt underneath). I wish they had a 4XL size.  Depending on the brand I can usually fit in a 2XL (but if too tight I get a 3XL and usually have extra room, with this hoodie it is more of a snug fit, it still fits ok though, just not enough room to wear another heavy shirt underneath, for when it is really cold outside).

Still I prefer a tall which I ordered over the regular that I got because the shrinking is less of an issue.Hanes CS has no actual help btw. You won't get a refund for the overcharge and they have no area for the issues of overcharge or wrong item sent and they require you to sign up for an account to use any of their CS order options as well.Since the item creator Hanes and seller Hanes are one and the same being HANES is the seller and HANES is the item tag, they are one and the same in this rare case on Amazon which btw also gives no protection or coverage to us in this sale. But again, it's an ok hoodie that I paid more for than I wanted or expected by the posted price vs the invoiced price so beware when ordering the different sizes ie Big and Tall vs normal size. A. you will be sent a normal size and B. although priced at one thing in the ad ($12 and change) and in your cart, at actual charging you will be overcharged by in my case 20% ($16) which is an important part of buying this particular product. Amazon is denying my reviews saying they are about seller but the product is made BY THE SELLER in this rare case. It's all one thing. There is no 'other guy' selling someone else's goods. In fact Amazon is the seller in this case because they are the second party contracting Hanes to sell Hanes. Anyway I ordered Big and Tall and that was on my invoice as well and I received a regular size AND the cost of the B&T was $12 and change as it still shows but I was charged $16 on my invoice.

It’s also great as it has a middle pocket for your phone or whatever else you want to bring around with you. I will say the one part of this hoodie that stands out as a con for is that the neck hole is a bit small and so putting it over your head is a pain but no big deal after a couple seconds of that ordeal. Then it’s spacious and nice for hours and hours.Don’t expect it to be extra long in length, as the shape of the hoodie is standard torso fit; neck to tummy. If anything, the length is slightly short relative to sizing - seeing as size L just meets the top of my thigh (for reference I’m 5 ft 4 and kinda fat). If you are taller or heavier and want something that reaches thigh, I recommend a size above L.The hoodie is very much a men’s build. It’s not feminine one bit and will not flatter a waistline or chest. It is very accommodating for bulkier builds, seeing as it has a lot of shoulder room, chest room, and sleeve length.

Sizes are great.  Very quick shipping too.I'm 5 feet and 127 pounds. The medium is perfect for me. My husband is 6 feet (yeah,he's a foot taller than me) and 165 pounds. The large is a great fit for him.Bought RED for both of us. He's a NCSU graduate so red is perfect.  It's a pretty red too.There are other colors that I liked. The navy and the tan, but one hoodie is sufficient.  I already have a black under armor hoodie too. It's too big for me and collects dog hair terribly. It's not lined either.With cold weather already here, this hoodie with the sherpa/fleece lining is a must have to keep us warm. Lately temps in 20's.  Will probably get colder weather soon. We live in Ezstern North Carolina so these low temps are not common. Very glad I have this hoodie.A really great purchase for under $20. Free shipping too as a Prime customer."", ""I really liked the sweater, it's doing great after a few washes. It's warmer than conventional sweaters. It does better than my faux fur and leather coat at making me feel warm, so 10/10 on being a winter sweater.My sister also bought one(black), and the sewing on her sleeves was a little shabby because of the nature of trying to sew two things together without taking a million years to make sure they're perfectly aligned. Mine (gray) was fine though. I normally appreciate the extra length but it's not hard to take the sleeves in a little to make it have that more fitted look. And when I zip it up there's not as much of that dreaded puff that makes me look even fatter. I think it was designed well with a good, deep hoodie that still works when I wear a bun or a hat (If you look closely, it has the middle stripe of extra fabric that makes it actually big enough for heads).Works pretty great in rain, I think because of the thick layers. I've worn it in bad weather like that twice now, and it's kept me pretty good and dry until the outer layer looks like it's gotten fully soaked. So it's good for when you have short walks in anything but the heaviest rainfall in my experience so far.There are two layers throughout the sweater. They're both thick, and the arms don't have the lining on the inside of the torso and hood, but an extra layer of the outside material. I like the decision, the sleeves would have been too cold for the target weather otherwise. Either way, the material does not feel too synthetic in my opinion. I like it.Overall, 10/10. If you can mend this sweater does not take a lot of effort to make it have a more custom fit, and it's well designed. It doesn't fall into the common sweater traps, and it's compensated for the things it can't do (like anticipate every body type on the belly-pudge). I'll probably end up buying another one."", ""I got a red one for my dad to go with the Santa hat he got for Christmas with the grandkids.  He tried it on and almost hasn't taken it off since.  He never thanks me for much of anything, but he thanked me for this.  He usually wears an XL or maaaybe a L in most brands and the XL fits nicely.  The thick lining does not make it too bulky over a couple of shirt layers.  I told him it comes in other colors, since he doesn't usually wear red, but he just wants to stick with this one.  It's not a very bright red, so it didn't match the Santa hat the best, but apparently it matches his lifestyle perfectly."", 'very nice sweater for the price. overall the fleece is not tooo thick and not too light . once you wear it feels like a regular hoody in terms of the thickness of material. not sure if this is normal for fleece lined sweatshirt like these, but every now and then i feel the wind through the materials.Tried it on when I first got it > fits like i wanted.

You would find better quality at Wal-Mart', ""I like the potential of this shirt but I have to find my size, and I also have some words about the fabric and its description.I'm a 39 inch chest for suit jackets (US suit jackets advertised as 38-40 inch fit best, and measuring tape under armpits is about 40 inches). The descriptions says poriff M is for 43.3 chest, so I thought that would be too big so I got S and M to compare. Poriff description is off (or it is not in inch units). M might be wearable but it is tight in the armpits, and if this is worn for workouts it would definitely limit movement (it doesn't stretch much; more on that later). I'll try L and XL, but the proportions/cut of the shirt also seems less for muscular upper chests (upside down triangle) and more for flatter (rectangular) proportions, perhaps even paunchier builds, since there seems to be a bit of extra room in the belly compared to the upper chest. I suspect people with more muscular upper torsos wearing a size that would accommodate them would have a lot of bagginess in the belly area (more than what the listing photos would suggest).The description also says this is 95% cotton and 5% spandex, but I suspect it's more of a cotton-polyester blend, if not fully polyester (and perhaps no spandex). The fabric itself seems fine but the description doesn't seem to match. Unfortunately there's not much stretch to it, at least, not compared to my 5% spandex - 95% polyester shirts, and what stretch it does have seems consistent with my 60-40 cotton-polyester shirts.This was the only shirt I've seen with hood, half-sleeves, simple construction (no zipper besides the pocket), and the zippered pocket seems very good, so I'm willing to give it a go, but I was really looking forward to having more stretch in it (although I'll have to see if the larger sizes will still look neat while moving well)."", ""So I kinda got this a size too small. Should've bought a larger size. Not sure if I went off of the recommended sizes but nonetheless a thin piece of clothing. I wanted it smaller size but didn't think it would be these measurements.(I didn't look at chart)I like the pocket/pouch on the front side, it's stiching looks legit and decent quality. Can hold small items and It doesn't seem like i would be damaged through washes.The hoody makes it extra stylish which can add umph to your Instagram shots or that kai green hoody look.The shirt is very fine/thin. Its not going to add to your confidence if you are lacking that but it definitely shows you what's really there. So if you suffer from gynacamesteca this is not the shirt to flaunt your newly developed bicep gains.I'm not familiar with the terminology with the making of shirts or printing techniques but the art seems like its printed-with but not-pasted-glued-melted on the shirt.

You would find better quality at Wal-Mart', ""I like the potential of this shirt but I have to find my size, and I also have some words about the fabric and its description.I'm a 39 inch chest for suit jackets (US suit jackets advertised as 38-40 inch fit best, and measuring tape under armpits is about 40 inches). The descriptions says poriff M is for 43.3 chest, so I thought that would be too big so I got S and M to compare. Poriff description is off (or it is not in inch units). M might be wearable but it is tight in the armpits, and if this is worn for workouts it would definitely limit movement (it doesn't stretch much; more on that later). I'll try L and XL, but the proportions/cut of the shirt also seems less for muscular upper chests (upside down triangle) and more for flatter (rectangular) proportions, perhaps even paunchier builds, since there seems to be a bit of extra room in the belly compared to the upper chest. I suspect people with more muscular upper torsos wearing a size that would accommodate them would have a lot of bagginess in the belly area (more than what the listing photos would suggest).The description also says this is 95% cotton and 5% spandex, but I suspect it's more of a cotton-polyester blend, if not fully polyester (and perhaps no spandex). The fabric itself seems fine but the description doesn't seem to match. Unfortunately there's not much stretch to it, at least, not compared to my 5% spandex - 95% polyester shirts, and what stretch it does have seems consistent with my 60-40 cotton-polyester shirts.This was the only shirt I've seen with hood, half-sleeves, simple construction (no zipper besides the pocket), and the zippered pocket seems very good, so I'm willing to give it a go, but I was really looking forward to having more stretch in it (although I'll have to see if the larger sizes will still look neat while moving well)."", ""So I kinda got this a size too small. Should've bought a larger size. Not sure if I went off of the recommended sizes but nonetheless a thin piece of clothing. I wanted it smaller size but didn't think it would be these measurements.(I didn't look at chart)I like the pocket/pouch on the front side, it's stiching looks legit and decent quality. Can hold small items and It doesn't seem like i would be damaged through washes.The hoody makes it extra stylish which can add umph to your Instagram shots or that kai green hoody look.The shirt is very fine/thin. Its not going to add to your confidence if you are lacking that but it definitely shows you what's really there. So if you suffer from gynacamesteca this is not the shirt to flaunt your newly developed bicep gains.I'm not familiar with the terminology with the making of shirts or printing techniques but the art seems like its printed-with but not-pasted-glued-melted on the shirt.

If it's not unbearably hot outside, I'm in a hoodie. I layer them, I wear them by themselves, I wear them around the house, hell I've been tempted to wear them to formal occasions because I like them so much. With that being said, these are the absolute best hoodies I've ever owned. I own both the hoodie version and the crew neck version of these and have them in multiple colors already with more to come. What makes these so perfect? It's not just the way the inside feels, yeah the fabric is nice and soft and you almost don't want to wear a shirt underneath because how soft they are. However, the thing that really sets these apart, are the cuffs and the waistband. Unlike many hoodies and sweatshirts that have cuffs which fit tight around your wrists, these cuffs are nice and relaxed. Because they are relaxed, they actually come down and sit on my hand the way I like them instead of being really tight around my wrist. This kind of has the same effect when it comes to the waistband. I hate regular tight waistbands on normal hoodies. They cause the hoodie or sweatshirt to start wanting to come up as your walking, this results in you having to pull it back down multiple times. With the waistband being relaxed though. The stay where you want them to. Fellas, do yourself a favor and buy extras of these hoodies. The second your girl gets a hold of one, it'll be hers, so just get ahead of the curve and be prepared with extras.""]"

I find myself getting too hot whenever wearing it, even working outside in ~15 - 20F weather.-Material:I personally like the material. The inside has a sort of patterned black lining with a sort of """"rubber"""" feel to it. (I don\'t like using the word rubber for it, but it\'s about the closest approximation I can get). Assumably the material is there for extra insulation and waterproofing and I can assure you that I\'ve never once felt a drop of water make it inside this coat after wearing it for multiple months and in the heavy rain a few times already.-Zipper:This one is important to me, because really, if it falls off the coat becomes a lot less useful. The zipper is made out of a really nice (brass?) metal, which will NOT easily fall apart. I\'ve had coats in the past where zippers falling off was an issue, so this durable zipper is definitely a plus.-Pockets:It has the obvious two outside pockets, as well as an inner left hand side pocket about halfway up the chest. I find it perfect for storing my phone, especially since I know it won\'t be getting wet in there.-Comfort:It definitely is not a giant pillow strapped to you. There is a textured feel of the material itself that is not soft and cushy, but more textured than anything else. I wouldn\'t say it felt uncomfortable at all, I personally like the material and find it hard to see why anyone would dislike it.-Weight:It\'s definitely heavier than some other zip ups I\'ve had and I love it. The weight really makes it feel like it\'s actually living up to what it\'s worth, while not being too heavy to make it a burden to wear.-Size:I bought a large and I usually wear large shirts, XL if I want a bit looser and Large seemed to fit me perfectly. Not much else to say about size.-Build Quality:This coat is DEFINITELY built VERY DURABLY. I\'ve tossed it around, got it caught on things, rubbed up against wood/metal etc. and this jacket just holds up very well. It feels very nice and not like a cheap thin or plastic jacket would.Cons:The only real con I could think of is possibly the lack of a ""super comfortable"" inside material.

That being said, it still is something I can wear all day and have no problems with.Overall: I definitely recommend this to anyone who really needs a warm transitional coat from summer to winter and also a coat that\'ll work underneath another to keep you even warmer.

I\'ve had coats in the past where zippers falling off was an issue, so this durable zipper is definitely a plus.-Pockets:It has the obvious two outside pockets, as well as an inner left hand side pocket about halfway up the chest. I find it perfect for storing my phone, especially since I know it won\'t be getting wet in there.-Comfort:It definitely is not a giant pillow strapped to you. There is a textured feel of the material itself that is not soft and cushy, but more textured than anything else. I wouldn\'t say it felt uncomfortable at all, I personally like the material and find it hard to see why anyone would dislike it.-Weight:It\'s definitely heavier than some other zip ups I\'ve had and I love it. The weight really makes it feel like it\'s actually living up to what it\'s worth, while not being too heavy to make it a burden to wear.-Size:I bought a large and I usually wear large shirts, XL if I want a bit looser and Large seemed to fit me perfectly. Not much else to say about size.-Build Quality:This coat is DEFINITELY built VERY DURABLY. I\'ve tossed it around, got it caught on things, rubbed up against wood/metal etc. and this jacket just holds up very well. It feels very nice and not like a cheap thin or plastic jacket would.Cons:The only real con I could think of is possibly the lack of a ""super comfortable"" inside material. Like I said before, it doesn\'t matter to me, but it\'d probably be a bit nicer if it did have a softer inside material. That being said, it still is something I can wear all day and have no problems with.Overall: I definitely recommend this to anyone who really needs a warm transitional coat from summer to winter and also a coat that\'ll work underneath another to keep you even warmer. It\'s durable, built to last, pretty much everything a good coat is.', 'I was looking for 2nd jacket as I have one of these already.This jacket is the best for me because: its a little roomy so you can even wear a sweat shirt underneath if you need to, not too bulky so you can move around in it,  the rain defender feature is a must have if you\'re in and out of your vehicle during the day when its raining, thermal lining is very warm even if only wearing a t shirt underneath, inside chest zippered pocket is a must have for me and not all hoodies have this feature, I\'m gonna give my Carharrt Sherpa lined hoodie away to someone else because that jacket although it is warm its a little bulky and I don\'t like the silk sleeve lining.Best of all Amazon listed it as used at $47.00 which i was skeptical about. I don\'t usually buy used clothes.This jacket was brand new with all tags still on the garment. Someone probably tried it on and didn\'t like it and just returned it.

It fit as I expected however it could be about half an inch longer, I have a very muscular build so the chest is tight on me but not uncomfortably so by any means, if you want a loose fiting jacket I would recommend sizing up one from your usual, but if you prefer a form fitting one stick with your normal size. The material is excellent and the zipper is heavy duty which is a plus, and the sleeves are a perfect length especially if you wear a watch. The overal quality of the jacket is very high and it is constructed very well. Also the jacket is quite warm, I wear mine out into negative temperatures and stay warm for a while in it. Overall I would highly recommend this jacket, it is simply great.', 'Tighter fitting than normal.', ""Husband is a big fan but he enjoys low-quality hoodies.This is a very thin hoodie. Suits him well since we live in southern California. I'm a big fan of the color; it's lovely. I think the material will pill easily. I noticed signs of pilling after the first wash/dry. So from then on, we have been washing and air drying. Husband is 6' tall and the sleeves and waist are both long enough for him. The waist doesn't fit too loose. The hoodie ties are a little obnoxiously long.I'd imagine the entire hoodie will stretch easily over time. This will likely last a few years before becoming so stretched, pill-ed, and stained that we throw it out. But he wears this hoodie or it's black version nearly every day."", ""I've had a lot of hoodies, this one fits well for me. I'm 6'1 198lbs, and the medium fits snugly as I was hoping. Form fitting.Zipper is pretty long, and the collar has a square-ish point to it that seems a little uncomfortable to my neck when closed all the way, but maybe that's just me.Sometimes it tells me what to do. Now, I know what you're thinking, but this hoodie has told me to carry out a lot of high profile jewel heists... and the dares, while fun, are escalating. I have a concern that this hoodie might make me steal a national landmark, or the Blarney Stone... or something.Solid 4 stars."", ""As a light sweatshirt, I like this. Construction/stitching is decent, the fabric is light and comfortable without being thin and fragile, the colors and fabric hold up well in the wash, the zipper is good, and the pockets are placed right/are the right size.But I have two complaints about this sweatshirt.First, I don't like the color. In the picture, it's a denim blue, but it real life it's more of a periwinkle purple. Not really what I was going for.Second, it's too small. It's roughly the right size, but just a touch too small. I've been wearing XL sweatshirts for years, and this one is a half-size smaller than I expected. It's snug through the shoulders and chest, and around my forearms.  The cuffs are so snug that I can't roll my sleeves up at all (not tight on my wrist, but definitely not going over my forearms. I'm a big guy (which is why I wear XL shirts), but I'm not oddly proportioned, or anything -- muscular but husky, rocking the dad-bod -- and this sweatshirt just isn't comfortable.""]"

You would find better quality at Wal-Mart', ""I like the potential of this shirt but I have to find my size, and I also have some words about the fabric and its description.I'm a 39 inch chest for suit jackets (US suit jackets advertised as 38-40 inch fit best, and measuring tape under armpits is about 40 inches). The descriptions says poriff M is for 43.3 chest, so I thought that would be too big so I got S and M to compare. Poriff description is off (or it is not in inch units). M might be wearable but it is tight in the armpits, and if this is worn for workouts it would definitely limit movement (it doesn't stretch much; more on that later). I'll try L and XL, but the proportions/cut of the shirt also seems less for muscular upper chests (upside down triangle) and more for flatter (rectangular) proportions, perhaps even paunchier builds, since there seems to be a bit of extra room in the belly compared to the upper chest. I suspect people with more muscular upper torsos wearing a size that would accommodate them would have a lot of bagginess in the belly area (more than what the listing photos would suggest).The description also says this is 95% cotton and 5% spandex, but I suspect it's more of a cotton-polyester blend, if not fully polyester (and perhaps no spandex). The fabric itself seems fine but the description doesn't seem to match. Unfortunately there's not much stretch to it, at least, not compared to my 5% spandex - 95% polyester shirts, and what stretch it does have seems consistent with my 60-40 cotton-polyester shirts.This was the only shirt I've seen with hood, half-sleeves, simple construction (no zipper besides the pocket), and the zippered pocket seems very good, so I'm willing to give it a go, but I was really looking forward to having more stretch in it (although I'll have to see if the larger sizes will still look neat while moving well)."", ""So I kinda got this a size too small. Should've bought a larger size. Not sure if I went off of the recommended sizes but nonetheless a thin piece of clothing. I wanted it smaller size but didn't think it would be these measurements.(I didn't look at chart)I like the pocket/pouch on the front side, it's stiching looks legit and decent quality. Can hold small items and It doesn't seem like i would be damaged through washes.The hoody makes it extra stylish which can add umph to your Instagram shots or that kai green hoody look.The shirt is very fine/thin. Its not going to add to your confidence if you are lacking that but it definitely shows you what's really there. So if you suffer from gynacamesteca this is not the shirt to flaunt your newly developed bicep gains.I'm not familiar with the terminology with the making of shirts or printing techniques but the art seems like its printed-with but not-pasted-glued-melted on the shirt.

I can\'t speak to long term wear exactly but they do seem to be of good construction and material. I was honestly kind of surprised, especially for the price. I would expect these to be $30+ in that respect.However these are not anything close to a ""slim fit"" . I dont even think these get any narrower in the leg!

Meaning not at your... Idk where you bend over. Right above your junk but below your gut. Like I think most guys wear pants and shorts. I believe that would be a low rise. So medium would be about half way or slightly less to your belly button. However they still don\'t look right. I usually wear ""slim"" or usually ""slim-straight"" jeans depending on the brand. If you\'re the same or wear skinnies these are not for you at all.Either the fit consistency is super inconsistent or you\'re overweight/probably obese or roided up and then they might seem slim to you. Trust me I work out and have a bubble butt from it. It pops out there lol. I am however not roided. These are a bit saggy there and look bad and definitely does not show it off.

They feel great in the sun, and they have the buttoned rear pockets to keep my money from falling out -- great security feature.The shorter inseam harkens back to the good old days not too long ago (OK, 20 to 30 years ago) when wearing short shorts was the thing.  They\'re comfy; well built and well designed; and the price is right.Only downside: the front pockets are about 1/2"" to 1"" shorter than I would like, and what I typically find in the Docker shorts.  But then again, Dockers now a days don\'t have buttons in the back pockets in most models so I think it\'s a fair tradeoff for the price.  My big Samsung phone (Galaxy S21) plus my minimalist wallet still very comfortably fit in my front left pocket.  However, if you\'re the paranoid type or have a huge wallet or much larger phone you\'d like to keep in your front pocket (or an unwieldy key chain), then these shorts aren\'t for you.

The cut of the inner short has no contouring or cut to 'support the boys' hence wearing these command will be a no go from hear on out. Moist is a good word to describe my over all experience. The outer short is is made of a heavier but light weight material. It feels smooth, doesn't appear that it will snag and looks good. I like the pockets, drawstring and t-shirt/towel loop holder - smart design. This outer fabric has some stretch but not enough to do much more that sit...don't try yoga with these because any stretching behind that of a coach potato and you'll experience resistance in all the wrong places. I'm a true medium and these make me feel like I have more of a booty that I do. (meaning these were cut for those flat butt types - no hate, just saying).All in all - you get what you pay for. If you are on a budget, this is a no brainer, buy now! If you are not looking for any type of support for the boys with the added bonus a non-breathable fabric, look no further, these are of you! If you've got some extra case and the fertility Dr. doesn't want the boys to over head then break out that wallet and look for a name brand alternative that's 4x the price."", ""I'm a larger guy and wanted to get some shorts for jogging to get back in shape, for athletic shorts, I typically wear size XL but this time I had to get a 2XL, I have larger thighs and waist due to a couple years of sitting around. My waist size is 36-38 and the XL is very tight on me. It puts all the goodies on display and would more than likely rip in half during warm-ups as it wasn't stretchy on me and didn't wanna break them before returning them. Size 2XL fits almost perfectly on me, but I do have complaints. Another review mentioned the weakness of the drawstring and I would have to agree. It is very stretchy and you have to really sinch your waist to keep them up with a phone in the pocket. Even at full tightness, I had to keep pulling my shorts up to keep them from falling to my ankles. You basically have to pull them up as high as they can go and tie them as tight as they can go just to keep them up long enough to not be annoyed with continuing to pull them up. After one 2 mile session of jogging with warm ups and stretches, I notice where all 4 seams come together is holding on for dear life. For now, these are alright, good if I'm being generous, I'll update after while to see how these hold up.""]"

I was kind of annoyed when you could no longer find them anywhere. These 3G Speed X shorts seem to be the successor to the 2.0.

Long are also the same length but you only get it in length, not inseam, which means less space in the crotch. 3G Speed X XL-Tall = 3G Speed 2.0 XL.-I bought 6 pairs of these all around the same time, and wear them all equally, but on two pairs the elastic started to warp after wearing them just a few times. It rolls up while wearing it, and doesn't return to it's normal shape. It only happened on the two I have with white waistbands.

Tie 3-4 more knots over the existing ones.+On the other hand I do think the styles on the Speed X are nicer, though if the waistband warps they look cheap.The pockets are pretty shallow, but so were the 2.0. They're okay if you're not active, but they're useless if you're moving around.Overall, these 3G Speed X are decent shorts.

They\'re stupid shallow.  Cannot keep anything in these and expect it to stay put. You WILL lose anything you put in the side pockets. For my use case, I like where the cargo pockets are situated. I will use these shorts primarily for kayaking and fishing.Durability remains to be seen.

They are just stretchy enough that they are comfortable and I can even wear them without a belt if I want but I usually do wear a belt. The belt they came with is not very useful in my opinion but if you don't have a belt I suppose it could be useful. I love the placement of the cargo pockets but the normal left and right pockets are little shallow in my opinion. I still love them but sometimes large things will fall out of my pocket. The mini key pocket with the carabiner ring is perfect. I don't carry too many keys so it works great but if you have a large key chain it might not work for you.

I'm not sure if the thicker material on the Shallowlulu just provides more padding or if it has something to do with the way their sewn, but these are just not nearly as comfortable.

I bought a pair of the well-known brand Under Armor and these, because they were half the price and I wanted to compare them. UA has changed their material and sewing methods and offer no actual compression, especially around the quad. Over-priced garbage now. Be a sheep if you want to but you'll be spending more time in the ice bath because you wanted to fit in.Champion makes good products but has never been known as a premium brand. When I put them on I instantly felt a difference. They are tight without being constricting, wick away sweat and are long enough to protect all the necessary muscles and tendons in your upper leg. I will not be buying anymore UA gear, and I will absolutely order more of these. I appreciate a company that puts their money into the product and not advertising.The price was great considering I can get twice as many pairs as UA. Any athlete knows that when it comes to protecting yourself from injury with sports gear, it's about Function, Quality and Efficacy. These do the trick amazingly well, and something tells me my muscles aren't going to care what name is on the tag or how much they cost. Highly recommend."", ""I bought these knowing that the percent of spandex, 16%, would provide a lower amount of compression than some of the more expensive compression shorts.

All of this earned these shorts four stars.One thing that I have not liked with previous compression shorts I've owned is the lack of any feature that prevents crushing of my boys. With the advent of pouch front underwear this problem went away for my everyday wear. But with few exceptions, the pouch front has not really found its way into compression shorts. These shorts are no exception. However, and this is what gives these shorts the fifth star in my review, the have an insert panel in the front that is only 8% spandex. While the mfg identifies this panel as being for ventilation, it also serves as a pseudo-pouch. The stretchier material expands more than the body of the shorts to allow more room, but no excess room, for my junk. Very comfortable.""]"

I've been wearing Nike and Under Armor (UA) compression shorts, the same 10 pairs or so as underwear for years (some size medium, some large). Recently, I bought some new UA shorts size LG, and the waist band feels like it is trying to cut off the circulation to my legs. I've put on a little weight... But not THAT much (6ft 220lbs, size 36 waist). So I ordered a pair of the Nike's size LG, they kept the boys a little too snug and the thighs were much tighter than the UA (I have larger than average thighs so I'm used to that with most clothes I buy), but the waist band was a tiny bit better, but still painful after a while. So then I found these champion shorts for more than half the price, so I gave them shot. They feel just as quality, but the waist band was just as tight as the Nike's, but the thighs felt better. I decided to order a pair of the XL just to see if I liked them more... The shorts feel a bit looser, but not by much, I was hoping the waist band would be much looser (now beginning to kill my self confidence after finding the XL still feels too small lol). Today I gave in, swallowed my pride and ordered an XXL hoping that these will finally be the shorts that fit me. Maybe I just prefer them looser than most people, but the LG and XL would leave harsh red rings around my waist after wearing them all day, and I've never had these problems until I started ordering all these new ones... Again, I'm not in the best shape, but I'm not in terrible shape, so I don't see why I would have to order an XXL for someone my size. Anyways, if I were you, I would order 1 to 2 sizes larger than you think you need.Maybe someone here can correct me. Maybe a size 36 waist should be buying an XL or XXL? I don't mind them tight, but not so tight where they leave painful rings around my waist. And I realize they stretch out over time... Which is probably why I could wear a medium with no problem for years. Most days I resort back to wearing one of my pairs that are a few years old just to not deal with such a tight waist band.

I was 15, and thought I should be hitting the weight room soon. I Before I got to the gym my first day, I expected to see others that looked just like me working out. When I got there, my heart deflated. Others were wearing similar athletic shorts, and a cutoff or short sleeve shirt. But I could tell that wasn\'t it. Just observing the way they walked, they way they talked, how they interacted with others, I could tell without a second thought that each and every one of them were wearing compression shorts.

It is very stretchy and you have to really sinch your waist to keep them up with a phone in the pocket. Even at full tightness, I had to keep pulling my shorts up to keep them from falling to my ankles. You basically have to pull them up as high as they can go and tie them as tight as they can go just to keep them up long enough to not be annoyed with continuing to pull them up.

A bit panicked when looking for the fly when you forget what pants you are wearing.  Having no closure at the waist an no fly will have you pulling up the leg in a hurry.', 'Debunking the belt issue:First off, 1st or 2nd review of a couple hundred purchases on Amazon.  In short, I love these shorts and there have been some reviews that voiced a concern with the belt; however, they are somewhat misguided.  I\'m writing this review because they are by far my favorite shorts and really, really do not want them to ever be discontinued....For some reason, Columbia stitches the cardboard tag for the shorts through the belt of the shorts on the RH rear side.  A typical consumer, myself included, just rips off the tag, puts them on and goes about his business.  The problem is that the two threaded stitched loops that were used to attach the tag typically DO NOT come off when that cardboard tag is ripped off - they stay there attached through the belt.  As a result, the belt is attached to the rear of the shorts and will not slide to adjust when tightened.  A simple solution is to use a pair of scissors to cut those stitched loops off.  At that point the belt is fully adjustable and actually works really well.  AGAIN, JUST CUT OFF THE STITCHED THREAD LOOPS THAT GO THROUGH THE BELT USED TO ATTACH THE TAG.I actually almost threw a pair away for this reason, but was going to cut out the belt for other uses and came across the stitching.  I wish they would note this, or even better, not stitch through the belt, but they\'ve been doing this for years.  COLUMBIA, DO YOU READ THESE???As mentioned before, these are by far my favorite shorts and I have at least 8 pairs.  I wear the shorter 9"" ones for wade fishing or jet skiing.  I prefer the 11"" ones for hiking, general around the house duties or going out.  They are a very comfortable nylon, are cool, very fast drying and breathe extremely well in hot weather.  I live in Ohio, but spend a lot of time in SW Florida and these are comfortable in both locales.  I\'m 5\'-10"" and about 170#, well.. 180#, and the mediums sit well and don\'t have to be hiked up all the time like other shorts. The 11"" hits the middle of my knee and the 9"" hits a hair above the kneecap. There is a mesh brief inside that is not too tight or to short, so undies are not needed to be worn.  They don\'t fade, I have had none fail in stitching, they don\'t pill, hold up to 100\'s of washings, are stain resistant - seriously they are darn near perfect.  I honestly can find no fault with these shorts other than the issue with the tag stitching and that\'s easily remedied.There\'s a zippered side pocket for phone or wallet and two front pockets.  None in the rear.I\'m surprised that nobody else pointed this out, but it is not really obvious.I really don\'t write reviews, but I\'d love to hear your feedback on this one if that\'s how it works.-JK', 'Seem to be well made and the belt holds up the shorts when the pockets are full of stuff unlike drawstring shorts', ""The built-in belt doesn't work well.

I was most impressed when I wore these in a horrendous night of rain where these shoes spent a good number of seconds with water coming over the toes- and they remained waterproof. Very impressive.  I am still not  a fan of the soles and that is the only reason for not giving five stars.  When walking the soles feel they are very narrow.  I feel I am walking on a narrow beam and they also have a very solid feel near zero spring in the step, not friendly for sidewalk or road walking but maybe that was not the intent.

He’s in the Marines & has to maintain a weight so he runs at least the 5 days he’s at work because the weekend is for Golf Only, where he still wears these shoes for that too. Since he does run so much, he had a specific shoe he’s worn for the past 7 years (before that it was one specific shoe for the other 3 years). Point being we find a shoe that doesn’t make his legs hurt & we stick to them. What triggers the change? When the “new & improved” versions come out & I can no longer find a 13 in the specific shoe he wants we have to find the new shoe. Now on to this Product; (I have the womens version of this shoe. I love mine. My daughter & 2 sons also have them & everyone said their comfy). I got these & we average at least buying 3 pairs of shoes a year that’s how quick they “wear down”. They last usually 4 months minimum & can of course still be worn but usually the padding or the soles become slick. What was surprising was these are branded as Running Shoes & had a decent tread in the beginning however this morning when packing his running bag, I seen the shoes were slick. COMPLETELY SLICK, on both shoes! I was really surprised because usually by this time the insides are worn down more than the bottoms so he can wear them around but these were like smooth….. I mentioned it this morning & he said when he was golfing this weekend, he was warming up at the Range & mid-swing (since the mats were wet from the morning dew) his foot slid up out from under him.So, maybe the quick review answer is; I have them & “walk” the dog down the road daily & I use them for baseball & softball practice with our kids. I use them on a Treadmill & Elliptical. I guess my use is Minimal to Standard. For these shoes I’m reviewing My Husband uses the shoes for Running Miles…. Five times a week. I think he said 5-6 miles is the trail on base & then wearing them when he’s out of uniform. His usage is more Standard to Intense. My only explanation is that the material on the bottom is very lightweight, which is what makes them so light on your feet however; it’s not strong & durable on a Road or Sidewalk.I hope this helps….

I planned on wearing them to shovel a path to my car to get my waterproof/ insulated work boots to wear while finishing the driveway but I just left these on when I saw how well they stayed dry.

I wear 12 and 13 in some shoes and I got 12 in these and they are a little loose. So I would go 1/2 to 1 size smaller. I like that they are easy to clean and they also look really good with Joggers. The shipping was free and overnight with my Prime Membership. I wake up at 4 so being able to have these at my door the next day at 530 am was very nice. At work, they still have a little bit of slide to them but they are pretty much slip resistant. Especially to even my most grippy regular athletic shoes including Nike, New Balance and Brooks.

(I don't really do any other sports, besides power walking, any more...)I bought my first pair after they were recommended to me by a friend; I was skeptical that a sneaker at this price-point would compete with the much more expensive workout-shoes that I've been buying ever since I had a nasty case of plantar fasciitis a few years ago, but I was quickly won over.  I've bought two more pairs since then!  The memory foam provides the right amount of cushioning for me -- it's easier on my knees, ankles, and feet than almost anything else I've tried, but at the same doesn't feel spongey or too soft.Although I plan to continue buying these as long as Skechers keeps making them, they do have one weakness: I suspect that the memory foam doesn't do particularly well with sand.  I went for a few long walks on the beach this summer, and noticed a while later that the memory foam insole was worn down a lot soon after -- I suspect that the sand in my shoes abraded the soft material that covers the foam.

They are lightweight and comfortable to walk/run in. “Cushioned” is probably the word I’m looking for.

Not sure how to describe it other than mesh or mesh-like. Not sure how they’re going to hold up or their longevity (as they are still fairly new). It’s most unusual with the tongue of the shoe. It does not have the rigidity or stiffness of your typical shoe. The material is kind of flimsy and very thin (compared to the norm). You have to wrestle the tongues into place and make sure they stay there. There is some elasticity there. Regardless, they do seem to stay put once you get them all tied up. Maybe I’m just not used to the material or difference yet. Something I would liked to have known before purchasing…so I’m sharing it with you!

However, for those runners that like to feel closer to the ground, the GT 2000 is a better fit for you.  As a general rule, when you take more comfort, you give up on durability.  I'll see how the Nimbus works out, but I have sensitive feet and prefer comfort over durability.  If you also enjoy comfort, the Cumulus is really good too and much cheaper.

I have been wearing Asics for 20+ years, mostly the GT-2000 series and its predecessor.  I have noticed over the last couple of years that the GT-2000 series have not quite felt the same in quality and comfort.  I had recently checked out a professional reading blog comparing the GT-1000 and the GT-2000 series.  It actually made note that the GT-1000s actually felt a bit more like the older GT-2000s. So, I gave them a try.  They felt okay.  But I had also started looking at the Kayano\'s.  Amazon had a pair that was almost half off the original price in a decent color scheme, so I decided to give them a try.  Out of the box they were one of the most comfortable pairs of running shoes I have ever owned. Having used them for 3 runs so far, they have been amazing with great support and cushioning.', 'I have been running in Kayanos for over 20 years (1998). I also have an MS in Exercise Physiology and have taken enough anatomical kinesiology and biomechanics classes to say, with a certain degree of certainty, that every 3-4 years gremlins seem to take over the design of the Kayanos and manage to screw up a good shoe. However, the stars have aligned and all is right in the world again.....the 28s emulate many of their successful predecessors. Enough of my sarcastic wit. Seriously, I would like to know if any of the shoe engineers at Asics are runners themselves or if they utilize focus groups before they unveil some of the more recent disasters. Regardless, the 28s are a keeper!', ""I've had a pair of Kayano 20's for a few years now which have held up great and provided solid cushioning for close to 1,000 miles of mostly sub-5 mile runs. I now have about 400 mi on the Kayano 28's and there is clearly significantly faster wear taking place on the traction sole of the shoe vs the 20s. Perhaps traction is better with the 28's and that is the tradeoff, though I never noticed an issue with traction with the 20's. Perhaps the 28's are more cheaply made, but if so, the savings have certainly not been passed onto the consumer, as the 28's were more expensive than the 20's. Overall I like the shoes, they are very comfortable and supportive. The fit is great (went with wide this time as the 20s put a bit too much pressure on my small toes at the same size, 12 1/2). I just have a strong feeling I'm going to be worn through the soles in half the time (or even less than half) than the previous Kayano 20's."", 'I have been wearing ASICS my entire adult life.

I think that for what I put them through these shoes have a fantastic and respectable life span and the price is right for the yearly replacement.  Its always a joy to see the new styles and I can have confidence that even if the colors change, the sizing is still the same.  ASICS for life!!!!', 'The Kayano 28 is meant to be a shoe with stability. Not all runners are build the same nor, importantly weigh the same.I\'m a 5 foot 6 inch 120 pound male, athletic build with a running back ground in track and cross-country running. I over pronate in both feet and more so in my right. My left foot is almost neutral. This gives me the advantage of seeing how shoes may work for both neutral runners and those who pronate.It was a hot, dry day when I tested the Kayano 28 on asphalt, concrete, hard dirt, grass, gravel-covered ground, a wooded trail and on a running track.  Oh, and on some stairs for stair work- more on that later. The Kayano is a road shoe first and foremost but can handle some light trail work.The shoe performed pretty well on all these surfaces but less well on gravel and it was a no-go on sand. No surprise there. it did okay on the light, groomed trail even as i was looking for rougher patches. it is a no go on technical trails which is no surprise.  And on stairs ... wooden stairs with good grip and nothing spaced too far apart. metal stairs are a straight out NO- that is super dangerous and you will have zero traction. It may look cool to do cardio on stairs to feel like Rocky Balboa but these shoes will not allow you to gain purchase on certain kinds of stairs.  For your safety, unless you got mad skills and a wish to break something, do NOT try running up and down stairs in the Kayanos. Walking- sure but be careful and aware.From experience, I am not sure how this kind of traction would do in wet conditions. the tread on the Kayaonos is pretty minimal and even tough it\'s AHAR, a fabulous material in its self, the tread design is best for flat, dry roads and other flat, even and dry, non-slippy surfaces.  Did  i repeat my self there? ....While the cushioning on the shoe felt nice after so many denser stability shoes i\'ve had, it was a bit too cushioned and there was not that much springy-ness as well.  When i ran on the track, which was a softer composite surface, it was like running on double cushioning which sounds nice but highlighted the shoe\'s biggest weakness and potential danger.it may be because I weigh only 120 lbs that there was not enough weight pushing on the cushion, but, this shoe was very unstable despite all its technology. I had to be very aware of how I placed my feet as I went trough my gait cycle or the mushiness would cause me to roll an ankle.  I tested them in all sorts of running modes, postures and techniques, etc ect - I ran track so basically did every kind of running style in them to test them out. This said, I decided to at some points to just ""trust"" the engineering and run with out thinking about my motion. the shoe in this case took over and did surprisingly well despite being unstable.  Doing this was risky and I felt that after a while the luck of it may wear off. and, in fact i had strained my ankle and Achilles tendon by the time I was done.  i did not  fully roll my ankle but repeatable came close.In many ways I should have known better. When i first put them on and stood up, I stumbles side to side as if the side walls of the mid sole were giving out. i have very good balance so this surprised me.After my test run, my left foot felt soso, not great but soso. My right foot, the one that pronates more, was not faring well as it was the ankle I had nearly rolled multiple times.  it took a few days for my ankle to recover but it could easily have been worse.Breaking the shoes in would have no effect since the Kayanos are so soft as is. it was like running on marshmallows.  While I can see potential in the 28th iteration, Asics needs to take more time to refine this shoe to be safe to wear for lighter runners.  For that, it needs to be less mushy and have a lower heel drop - that is the difference between the front stack height and the rear stack height.  It would also help if there were a bit more spring or responsiveness in the shoe as well.  The tread is almost too thin and could use a bit more. If the traction were a little more regressive, that\'d be a nice touch.In the end, I cleaned them up and sent them back.']"

Some people seem to be born with loads of empathy and know just what to say to support their friends and children to find their own best solutions to their problems. Some of us need a little help. I found it in this book and I'm so grateful to the authors!"", 'Many of us don\'t understand that we can\'t be happy because we won\'t let ourselves be happy. We\'ve been scared of feeling our emotions of fear or resentment or other tough emotions. As children, we often get the subconscious message that we aren\'t important, our emotions don\'t matter, and people don\'t care about us.In I Don\'t Have to Make Everything All Better, we learn that every human has a basic need to feel that they have worth, their feelings matter, and that someone cares about them. It gives six principles for how to treat others that way.  It has several examples of how to apply these principles with our children and others so they feel they have worth, that their feelings matter, and that someone cares about them. And if we\'re smart, we\'ll start to treat ourselves and our own emotions in the same way so we, too, can feel our feelings like we\'re made to do. Our feelings are where we ""feel"" fulfilled. If we\'re always stuffing them so we can\'t feel them, we won\'t be able to truly feel fulfilled (joyful and peaceful).Following these principles allows people to keep their problems and gives them the freedom to figure their problems out on their own with maybe just some carefully placed, considerate questions. We never have to take on someone else\'s problems (unnecessary weight on our shoulders). We never have to fix anyone\'s problems, because we can\'t make anything all better for anyone. We can only do that for ourselves, and so others must do that for themselves, too. And it\'s very gratifying for us and them when this happens, especially with our kids. No more need to control our kids emotions. There\'s now a method for letting them feel their emotions to let them process and pass. Then the problem solving can begin for the child. We don\'t have to fix their problems. We just have to be supportive in the right way and let them find their own solutions. This takes a huge weight off our shoulders as parents. This book can benefit just about anyone.', 'I have read this book twice and have given it to quite a few friends and have recommended it to even more people because honestly, this should be part of everyone\'s life manual.  I love his basic premise to Listen, Listen and then validate the feelings of others.  This book has helped me to be a better friend, mom, sister, aunt and human being.  It\'s also helped me to not try to run around attempting to ""fix"" everything around me because ultimately it\'s not my business.  I couldn\'t praise this book enough!', ""This is the 4th time I have purchased this book.  It helped me so much in dealing with my mother, who has borderline personality disorder, that I have purchased it 3 additional times for others that are faced with similar relationships as mine.  Probably the most life-changing concept that I learned from this book is that when you do everything for someone else, you are taking away the opportunity for that person to learn from their experiences. Because of this book, I have been able to let go of the guilt when I say 'no' to my mother's constant requests for my attention and help.  Don't get me wrong, my mother is 83 years old and needs help.  But when she calls me, crying, because she can't get the tv to work, I don't drop everything in order  to go fix her tv.  I suggest to her that she listen to a book on tape or find another activity.  She may not be happy with me, but this book has given me the courage to say 'no',  or when to say 'I'll get to it when I can', and not feel guilty about it.

Started out around 10k steps per day and in the 3 months I've worn them I got up to 25k steps a day.

These very reasonably-priced shoes are extremely easy to slip on, and they have a full range of widths.  My only concern is that they may stretch a bit too much with regular use (I am heavier than most folks), and as others have noted in their reviews, it is likely that the soles will wear out relatively soon if they are used heavily for walking on pavement.  Given the price, comfort and very nice look of these shoes, I think they are a very good buy.

They also look good, and slip on easily. I always wore size 10.5 until about ten years ago when sizes seemed to become less standardized. Now I usually wear between an 11 and 12. In these shoes, I still wear the traditional 10.5 or 10.5 wide, so keep that in mind when you choose a size.The reason I need to keep buying new pairs, even if they still look good, is that the soles wear out quickly. Once the tread wears off the sole, they become dangerous. They wear down to flat, slick spots were they contact the ground. A little bit of water on a smooth floor becomes like ice at that point. It\'s a situation where I am surprised and almost fall because it takes so little water to make them slick once worn. That\'s when I replace them. I tend to get about a year from the soles. The uppers would last much longer.I wish the tread material was better, but I like the shoes, the fit and the comfort enough to keep buying them. They look good enough to wear as dress shoes, but are comfortable enough for business casual.The color ""New Brown Gradient"" is interesting (this is my first pair in this color). Most of the shoe is a fairly normal brown, but it gets very dark near the toe. It\'s not a gradual change along the shoe, it just darkens the last 1-2 inches at the toe. It kind of looks like you were walking through wet grass and got the toes wet.

Easy to slip on, supportive, and good with jeans or dress slacks - this can be a go to pair.

These fit exactly the same as an 8.5 in women\'s. I read more than a few reviews that claimed these shoes run small and instructed people to go up at least half a size, but I would only do that if you\'re on the edge of your size (i tend to be in certain styles of Merrell\'s shoes), have wide feet, or plan to use inserts.I was worried these would be too hot for summer but they\'re fine! We\'ve had a bad heatwave the past 2 weeks and I don\'t find them particularly hot. I\'m really glad I didn\'t get the ""vent"" version because I hike every day with my dog and am really hard on my hiking shoes (I usually need a new pair every 3-6 months, no matter the brand). I\'ve owned a lot of different Merrell hiking shoes at this point (i usually just buy what\'s on sale) so I know I\'d tear up the ""vent"" fabric pretty quick on the vent version of these shoes. These shoes are heavy hiking shoes. They\'re still ""sneakers"" instead of boots, but they\'re probably the heaviest pair of hiking shoes I\'ve ever owned (i never wear actual hiking boots). I was surprised by how bouncy they still feel though! I guess that\'s one of the reasons they\'re so comfortable; i\'ve had hard hiking shoes and these definitely aren\'t hard!  You could run in them, but if you\'re a runner Merrell\'s actually makes a lot of different trail running shoes that would be better for that.I\'ve been hiking in them for the past month and my only complaint so far is the suede fabric: it\'s such a magnet for dirt and dust! I got them in the black/gray but ever since the first time I wore them they\'ve been covered with dusty dirt. No matter how much or how often I beat the dirt out of them they will basically always be tannish brown (the same color of the dirt where I hike).  It\'s bad enough that dust is always puffing out of them when I undo the laces. If you care about having a visible layer of dirt/dust on your shoes you might want to get them close to the color of the ground where you hike (although I suppose this could be different for people who don\'t live in a dry climate like i do?).I plan to update when these shoes crap out on me. I\'m curious to see how long the vibram soles last b/c I remember it only took me 3 months to wear completely through the last pair of shoes I had with ""vibram"" soles (probably 5+ yrs ago--back when Merrells was supposedly higher quality).  Of course these days I like to use shoe goo before it gets to that point, but we\'ll see how long it takes before i have to start smearing shoe goo on the bottoms to keep them from wearing all the way through.UPDATE: I just raised my rating to 5 stars because I\'ve been wearing these every other day since I bought them (so about the equivalent of 6 months) and they\'ve held up WAY better than expected! Most other hiking shoes (even of this same brand) would be trashed by now, yet I haven\'t even had to use shoe goo on them yet because the soles aren\'t worn through even a little. The treads are definitely getting worn and there\'s a tear in the tongue of one shoe, but neither of these things have created any problems yet (they don\'t even smell bad yet!). I\'m definitely going to stick with this brand and model from now on.  I think it helps that I never wore them in the rain (I\'ve noticed that every time I wear a pair of hiking shoes in the rain they seem to wear down really fast afterwards so now I only wear hiking shoes that I hate when it rains, which is easy considering it rarely rains here).', 'I like these shoes.

This one hits the spot...clean, classy, comfortable and with a great variety of colors. The insole is a big part of the magic...they are soft and comfortable. I also have tried on the newer Soft 8....I think the outersole on those is harder and not as pliable which I believe might take away from some of the comfort. My humble opinion...stick to the Soft 7.1) Not 100% comfortable out of the box...wear them around the clean house/carpet several hours before giving up on them...or ply them by twisting and folding and pressing in the back support.2) Laces are AWESOME...much higher quality than many of the other laces I have seen on these style of shoes3) Outer sole seems solid and should last for at least a few years....assuming you rotate a few shoes throughout the week.4) The upper is simply BEAUTIFUL...the dyes and finishes are very well done. One of the few shoes I am considering using some form of a protection spray to maintain the look.5) The fit for my feet...Instep was great...toe box a little wide for my need...arch is good for my feet and the heel fits well....unlike so many of this style, the heel is usually a bit wider than I need which results in my needing to ply and mold the heel a bit narrower so they don't slip.

The local store didn’t carry them but I figured I’ve rarely tried them on because they consistently fit.  So I bought them here (online) and wasn’t disappointed.  I find NB shoes last a long time and they’ve never come apart, even wearing them in all weather (including snow and rain).Over all I like these shoes.The tread design works well “off road”.  I use them to walk the dogs or jog in the woods on the local dirt trails. I find them comfortable and fit as expected and the traction is good.  Also, mud doesn’t cake in them, I’m able to easily stamp the dirt off.Two downsides:  1) the laces are thin (yet strong) strings which easily slide through the eyelets which I find difficult to snug the shoe. I pull and when cinching the knot they let go just a bit. Plus they come undone often.  It has been difficult to tighten the bottom and work up because they slide through the holes quickly. My running shoes have thicker laces and stay tight.  Yes, Laces are simple to replace.2) the arch support could be better. They do have support, but I could use a bit more.

I believe a good price on thses is around $100- I got em for just under that."", 'First, the reader should be advised that I\'m an ""old school"" guy that has spent a lifetime grousing about the cost of shoes ... ALL kinds of shoes ... tennis shoes ... dress shoes ... hiking shoes ... flip-flops ... you name it.  I\'m the guy that regularly prowls the shoe section at re-sellers like Marshalls and Ross, always searching for that once-in-a-lifetime bargain/value that miraculously shows up in my size ... ""you just gotta get there on the right day ..."" Am I right, men?While all that prowling has undoubtedly saved me a small fortune over the years, it also taught me something.  Sometimes, you just can\'t get what you really want unless you\'re willing to spend what it costs.  That\'s the way I feel about these shoes.  I knew I wanted a captoe Oxford in this color, and I spent a LONG time looking at LOTS of different makers/designers on Amazon.  I never found anything that looked as nice as these Cole Haans.For the reasons explained above, I never previously bought this label, so I wasn\'t sure about the sizing.  My last pair of high-end dress shoes were Bostonians (and yes ... I groused bitterly about the cost when I broke down and bought them), which ""ran short.""  I got those shoes in 13D, which fit and served me well through some pretty heavy use over a number of years.  So, I figured I\'d try the same in the Cole Haans.  My mistake ... in 13D they fit just OK at the widest part of my foot (a little tight, but not uncomfortable), but WAY too long in the toe, and just didn\'t fit my foot right.  Didn\'t have a lot of time to mess around, so I put the first pair aside and re-ordered another pair in 12EE (W), figuring that adjustment would make the perfect fit, and then I\'d return the first pair, after I was sure.The second pair fit my foot like a glove, right out of the box.  Very comfortable, and a perfect fit for my foot.  Unfortunately, with the second pair, I also noticed a small irregularity in the upper sole stitching on one of the two, right at the ball of the foot, and a blemish in the tanning on the tongue of the other.Knowing I would never be happy if I ""settled"" for that, I put that pair aside too, and ordered a THIRD pair, also in 12EE (W).  The third time was indeed the charm ... this pair was perfect in every respect, and in my opinion, worth every penny they cost.  The ""British tan"" finish is really nice, and exactly as shown in the photo.  The stitching is flawless.  The leather is supple and uniform throughout every surface of the shoe.  The heels and soles are very thick and strong ... a bit stiff at first, but I\'m a big guy, so that\'s fine with me.  My Bostonians had leather soles, and I realized (after wearing completely through one of them) that rubber soles, like these, work better for me because I do as much walking on outdoor surfaces like concrete and asphalt as I do on tile and other indoor surfaces.Amazon made my return of the first two pairs a breeze, and they started processing a full refund on my credit card the same day I dropped the return boxes off with UPS.  Thanks, Amazon ... you made this particular online shopping experience a real pleasure for me -- not only in helping me find these terrific shoes, but also getting them to me quickly, in the perfect condition and size I needed.  Once you figure out what size actually fits you, you\'ll love these Cole Haans ...', 'These shoes were a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting the same level of comfort and quality as two other styles I previously bought. These were not on that level. The cushioning seemed too firm and there was too little of it. The back of the shoe was very stiff, with no padding to prevent blisters or cushion the Achilles’ tendon. With a few modifications, these could be great. Perhaps they could also be great if broken in, if one were willing to suffer the inevitable blisters. I wasn’t impressed enough to think it would be worth the try. I knew the recipient of these wouldn’t wear them. And for the price I paid, despite the deep discount, I was disappointed, especially when compared to the comfort and quality of previous pairs in different styles. I expected more from the Cole Haan name. I will be returning these.', 'Great quality, as I\'ve come to expect from Cole Haan. I guess ""British Tan"" is lighter tan -- my pair is a lighter tan than shown in the photos, not the darker tone with a tinge of red, which is the look I usually go for and what seemed to be shown here. Finish is also not as -- not sure what the word is -- glossy. The finish on mine is more like flat paint versus a matte finish. Otherwise I\'d give five stars.']"

Only time will tell whether the Yokota feels as stable and durable on the trail (I suspect not).  But its nice looking and comfortable.  I\'m enjoying it so far.', ""I purchased 2 pairs at 55 each. I can't find a decent pair of shoes for less than 75 these are great. Not as good as the vibraum soled thicker versions, but I love these as my everday shoe."", 'My 3rd pair of merrils.bestshoes ever', 'I bought these to replace a similar pair of Merrell hiking shoes that had just completely worn out after years of hard use.  The new ones fit perfectly.  Seem to be of very good quality, and a fair price.  No complaints!', 'For several years of our long and happy marriage I disparaged my wife over the great number of shoes she had in the closet. Well that\'s stopped because I now have six different pairs of Merrill shoes. Although they are all great this last pair is by far my favorite.I never understood how two pairs of shoes, that look so much alike, could be so different. That would be why I was buying my work shoes at Walmart, and then wondering why they wore out so fast and were so uncomfortable over a long period of time. Then I started working with the client who did permitting for power lines. Their employees walk sometimes all day doing work on power lines. I noticed at a meeting one day that every single one of them had on a pair of Merrill shoes, so I asked them about it. Every person said they had become a fan of Merrill\'s when they realized you could walk in them all day and when you got home at night your feet didn\'t hurt. I have come home and had my wife say ""Would you like to take your shoes off and get into something more comfortable?"" I tell her I\'m just fine let\'s go somewhere to dinner.Right now I have these shoes on and I have been standing at my standup desk working, off and on, for over six hours. I move around because standing still makes my hips hurt, however, my feet are fine. They don\'t go to sleep, they don\'t hurt, and I feel as if I could just walk outside and start hiking home.By now you can see that I am an unabashed fan of the shoes and I have worn out more than my share of them. They clean up well in the washing machine (they make horrible noise in the washing machine), and for this type of shoe their reasonably priced.It is important when you buy Merrill shoes that you be specific about what you plan to use them for. I have a pair that I use when I go to the gym that I would not take on long extended hikes. The ones I am reviewing are buy general purpose shoes because they work well on jobsites, they work well in my office, and they\'re just comfortable to run around in. I don\'t wear them to the gym however, mainly because they are a little stiff for some of the things you might do in an exercise situation. And in the end that\'s why I own so many of them now.Good luck and enjoy these.']"

I bought some Dockers Straight Fit no iron and found them to be good quality, but the a little pricey. plus the Dockers do not come in the odd in between waist sizes. The Izod American Chino does come in a 31 waist, which works better for me now that I have lost a bit of weight and a 32 feels too loose. I thought the price for these Izods was very reasonable, but was unsure what kind of quality or fit I would get. I ordered the British Khaki and the Navy to find out if they would work on me.Fit: Definitely more of a contemporary fit compared to some of my older fuller cut pants from other brands. It\'s advertised as ""straight fit"", and I would say more closely fitted than the Dockers straight fit pants. The leg hole at the cuff is noticeably smaller than on the Dockers for a more tailored look, but without being too slim. I could squat down or kneel in my Dockers without hesitation. With the Izods on I am a more careful because I feel it\'s tighter in the thigh and seat. I could see how you might cause a blow out by suddenly contorting yourself. But probably true of any no-stretch clothing that fits more closely. Totally comfortable for normal sitting and walking though.Fabric: Seems the equivalent of what most makers are offering in their no iron khakis as far as weight and feel. Maybe a very slight sheen to the fabric which I don\'t mind at all. I tossed them in the washing machine and then ran them through the dryer at the wrinkle free cotton setting. Pants emerged without wrinkles. The key is to not put your wrinkle free stuff in a dryer packed with other clothing. Leave a lot of room in the machine so the other stuff doesn\'t crush and wrinkle the pants, and then remove immediately when dry and put on a hanger. Little or no shrinkage detected. The after wash fit seemed equivalent to the pre-wash fit. BTW, you can remove the annoying IZOD label by CAREFULLY picking at the row of stitching on the label surface with a sharp Xacto knife. Obviously this will void any possibility of a return. Do this before you wash the pants too many times, otherwise the fabric that was under the label will look different. The crease in the pant legs that was evident when they arrived in the packaging vanished after washing. Dockers seem to hold their crease even after wash. These IZODs will emerge from the wash as true flat front chinos. Fine by me. But if you\'re determined to have creases, then youneed to iron them back in.If they hold up well, I will likely order some more. They seem to be a great value. I sit at a computer most of the workday, so these pants should work out great for business casual wear.

I hope that Fjallraven becomes better known in the United States so we can see more of their products available here.SIZINGI am 5\'7"" 140 lbs. and my true waist measurement is around 29"". I received the Size 44 which is advertised as a US 28. That is inaccurate. The size 44 is really a 30x32. The inseam measures 32"" exactly. I wish there were more sizing options particularly for the inseam length but this is the shortest Fjallraven makes them available it seems. I shortened the inseam with a Euro Hem (aka Tricky Hem) so I could keep the original hems & their adjustable ankle straps. Note: According to Fjallraven\'s sizing guide the regular inseam length of a size 44 is 32"". The long version has a 34"" inseam. To get a shorter inseam length you would have to order a size 42. Size 42 has a 31"" inseam length for regular but, of course, it would have a smaller waist as well.MATERIALThe G-1000 material is similar to tactical pants fabric, light yet very sturdy though the G-1000 is a bit stiffer & more rugged than my Tru-Spec tac pants. They are relatively quiet pants with a slight swish sound if your legs rub. Water beads up & rolls off them nicely. I haven\'t gotten them soaked but I spot cleaned them & it dried very quickly. I prefer this material over the delicate nylon or thin polyester that typical hiking pants are made of.FITThese pants are a slim fit but give good room for movement. The knee areas are slightly pre-curved and allow easier movement. I can lunge, high-step & kneel wearing 2 base layers underneath: 1 light merino wool & 1 thick fleece. Each of my upper legs is 20"" around & with the base layers there is still comfort room in the thigh area.CONSTRUCTIONThere are no back pockets but instead there are several clever cargo pockets of varying size around the upper legs. However, because of the slim fit of these pants the options of what you can store in them are limited. They are not baggy so you cannot stuff the pockets with anything bulky. The hems have adjustable ankle straps built in with snap enclosures so you can tighten the bottoms around your boots to keep bugs/debris out. The hand-warmer pockets are a bit tight. In order to keep the fit of the pants slim & practical they went with a snug fit for the slashed hand pockets. There is extra fabric reinforcement on the knees/shins and on the rear-end of the pants. Stitching is well done and sturdy but I haven\'t slid down any hills yet to test it out. The pants are made in Vietnam, not Sweden, but Fjallraven has a legendary reputation so I have faith in their quality control.COLORI chose the Tarmac/Dark Olive color selection. The color \'Tarmac\' is a light olive drab with a slight hint of gray. Very earthy. I tend to favor khaki-colored pants to spot ticks easier but the tarmac color is light enough. The Dark Olive reinforcement areas give a nice, brownish contrast.ORDERINGI\'m glad Backcountry.com carries the Fjallraven brand. Hopefully they can expand on the Fjallraven products they carry. They arrived quickly with no issues.Overall a fantastic pair of trekking pants. They are very rugged & durable. I can go trailblazing without fear of my pants tearing on a snag. And as a slim guy these are the first hiking pants that actually fit well. Plus, they have a really cool look!', 'I am 6\' and about 165 pounds - I purchased Euro 46 or US 30""-31"" in regular length. Figure out your waist size AND the length. Fjällräven makes short, regular and long. Also - Vidda pro pants come vented and regular. Vented has a stretch material crotch and zippers on both outer thighs for ventilation. Pro regular does not and has a slightly different pocket configuration. Make sure you know which one you are ordering.I wear them any day of the week - not just hiking. They are also excellent for travel day. Keeps your wallet, passport and boarding pass in the front under a snap-close pocket for easy access through security and for boarding. In addition, they are more difficult for a pickpocket to get through in the big cities. These pants also have boot hooks at the bottom for serious terrain and you can close them around your boots at the cuffs. Again, top quality and will not disappoint. Don\'t waste your time or money on cheap Chinese junk. If you are serious, these are worth the money. These are top quality pants and will not disappoint.', ""Love these trousers. Great pockets, built to last, very clever retractable straps to tighten the bottom of the legs. The laces hooks are useful, and the pockets very well though out.

My legs stayed dry during any showers, no I had need to break out the waterproof trousers.Today we were walking in the woods around our village, T-shirt weather, and the trousers are breathable enough to prevent my legs getting too hot and tough enough to cope with brambles and dense undergrowth.Highly recommended, not cheap but as they say, ""Buy cheap, buy twice"".', 'What I received was not fjallraven trousers but a cheap knock-off.

Overall the fit was really good, the seat/hip/thigh was just right, not too roomy, but not tight and it looks nicely fitted.  It has a straight leg, but you can adjust the bottom tab and cinch it tighter, which I do as it feels too loose if I dont.  The inseam is about 31"" so for most average height guys around 5\'9 -10 it should be just right.  The front rise is on the higher side which is good, and gives a really flattering silhouette when worn.  All of the pockets are handy and I like the over abundance of belt loops.Fabric:  lightweight but we\'ll have to see how it feels in cold German weather. I plan to wear an under legging so I don\'t think it will be any issue.  I tried the waterproof test and when I poured water on it, it just beaded off and the pants stayed dry.  I don\'t expect to be in any torrential downpours, so I imagine these will repel whatever rain hits just fine. there\'s nothing worse than walking around with the rain soaking your pants thighs.Overall, these actually look really cool, fit very nicely, and the fabric seems to do what it says it does.

The issue is that it adds a bunch of thickness, so my belt doesn\'t really work super well.2) Speaking of the belt - The belt loops are SUPER close to the belt, so it\'s hard to get the tail end of my belt through my belt buckle. I know most folks probably don\'t use belt buckles with this type of pant, but I certainly can\'t be the only one.

Not unwearable, but a bit long.The material is very comfortable, especially with the stretchy characteristics of the fabric. The seams and stitching are good quality and straight, as you’d expect from Dockers brand. The pants did not shrink with normal washing and drying.Stylistically these are good for business-casual, or a just plain casual look. They can be dressed up, or down, which add to their versatility. I don’t love the relaxed fit, however. These tend to look a little too baggy, and I think I’d prefer a more fitted style.A couple of negatives:1. I think they’re a bit pricey for what they are. I think pricing them a bit cheaper would be a better value, though I recognize you’re paying for the brand name to some extent.2. The tags on these were excessive. As I was taking the stitching out of the labels (of which there were many!), I pulled a bit too hard, and created a small hole in the back pocket, before they’d even been worn! Frustrating! (see photo). Fewer tags would be nice, but as Dockers is unlikely to change that, just be very careful and deliberate in removing the tags. I was surprised at how little force it took to damage the material.', ""By looking at the outside of these Smart 360 Knit Dockers pants, you can’t tell that they are different than any standard pair of Dockers (we typically buy DOCKERS Men's Straight Fit Signature Khaki and Dockers Men's Classic Fit Flat Front Signature Khaki).These Smart 360 Knit pants have the same flat front, the same regular straight fit, the same fabric appearance (the knit isn’t different to the visible eye than a standard pair of pants), and the same crease down the legs making them dressy in appearance.Looking at them in the plastic packaging, my husband wondered why I bought him another pair of pants because he already has enough. I said “wait and see”. We got them out of the package and he brushed the outside of the pants and once again, they felt really similar to his existing pants.However, pulling them apart and putting them on he was BLOWN AWAY by how stretchy these pants are. Made of 84% Cotton, 16% Elastane (spandex), they are soft and comfortable, breathable, but so elastic and stretchy. The pants fit true to size and are machine washable (we air dry our Dockers so I can’t comment on how they’d do in the dryer).You get lots of pockets in these pants: the standard buttoned pocket in the rear on both sides, and on the front are double pockets on each side, with the right side having a zipper on the outer pocket.These pants do seem to be thicker and a little more warm than the all cotton pants, so my husband probably wouldn’t wear these in summer months unless he’s in air conditioning at the time.The waistband is advertised as a flexible one; we were not convinced that it is any more flexible than his typical Dockers. Also, these are advertised “as comfortable as your favorite sweatpants”. Well, the material is not fleece so we disagree but the elastic does make these much more comfortable than your typical pants.Overall, we really like these pants. We will still keep our old ones around for warmer months but these definitely have a use. These do come at a much higher price (we usually get standard Dockers on sale for half of the price of these), but the comfort is worth it and we would order these again.""]"

I ordered size XL, not knowing if the length would be okay because I am so used to going by inseam at my height. These pants fit almost right on the money ... but a bit sloppy and baggy-looking, the way 'old man Dockers' looked when our 60 year old neighbor would wear dress pants once or twice per year on holidays. The legs seem too wide/shapeless ... there is a LOT of extra room in the seat of the pants and crotch area, giving a wide look to the hips.While these are long enough for my 34 inch inseam, they are just a bit too short, exposing just enough sock to make me uncomfortable with loafers. I think they'd be very long for someone who wears a 30 inch, or short, inseam. A 32 inch inseam, or medium, might even bunch up a bit. The waist is a little flexible with hidden elastic expansion and an inside tie off. There are also belt loops, which are nice.The material is a bit odd, and almost hard to describe. It has a tag which states 'warm'. It's almost like a flannel weight ... kind of like moleskin without the softness or flocking. It is more comfortable to wear than I thought it would be ... it felt a bit stiff/course/hard but the inside is a bit softer and feels like a regular pair of thick, khaki pants. These don't quite feel like sweatpants but don't quite feel like dress pants, either. I could wear these all day ... as a bigger guy, slim fit khakis can be really uncomfortable in the waist and especially the leg/calf area. These are a pleasure to walk in, sit down in or lay down in.If comfort is your reason for buying these, you won't be dissapointed. I'd give them a 10 out of 10 on comfort. If you are buying them for looks, I'd say 5 or 6 out of 10. They are a bit shapeless and baggy in the leg and look like you bought a pair of dress pants that they didn't quite have your size in. It looks like maybe the length is a smidge too short on me, while the waist and cut is a bit too large. With a sweater or button-up, they are passable. Great for walks around the neighborhood with the dog, raking leaves, lounging on the hammock ... and even can be worn with a blazer and dress shirt to the office.Overall, these will be my 'around the house' comfort pants but its likely that I won't wear them in public. Better for fall and winter than summer, for sure. I ordered the military green color, which might add to the 'dad vibe' as they are a little old fashioned, like something which was military surplus that came from an Army-Navy store. I am rather picky about my fashion ... so maybe I am being too critical of the wide leg style. The hardest part you'll need to decide is what size to get. The waist seems to fit 36 (with a belt), 38 or even 40. The length a 34 or maybe 32 inseam. I prefer buying pants/jeans with more normal pant sizing than S, M, L, XL, which in my view is better for sweatpants/track pants. However, these look/fit a lot better than I honestly thought they would."", ""I love these pants. They're made of really soft and comfortable cotton, and they're really easy to wear. The fit is relaxed, so they're not going to be too tight or constricting, but they still have a little bit of shape to them. They have a nice tapered leg that sits below your waist, which means you can actually fold them over if you want to make them look like shorts."", 'These pants are so nostalgic for me! I used to wear pants just like this circa 2001. A bit baggy, straight leg. This style is coming back, I guess. It has been 20 years, after all. Can’t wait to get back into my mid-90s JNCO jeans ;)I’m about 6’1” and usually wear a 32 or 33” waist. The medium fits me quite well, though I don’t need the drawstring at all. The elastic + button front is plenty tight enough for me. I like the style and color/pattern. These really do feel like a nice transitional pant for me to get accustomed to real adult pants again after working in sweat pants for most of the last 2 years…The quality is great, as I’d expect from Levi’s. I’m sure they’ll hold up a long time.Alas, I still feel like these are a bit baggy for my current style preferences. I’ll definitely keep wearing them, but I prefer the regular Levi’s XX chino that look and fit a bit closer to my body.']"

This Flat Front Slim version allows a 31x34, fits just as well on my waist but allows more length and just a slight more room in the leg. They are now my favourite pants for office work and go great with a business shirt or even a polo for the casual days.My waist is exactly 83cm (32.5 inches) and 88cm (34.5 inches) length from bottom of ankle to waist belt area.As I have used IZOD pants for a few years now, these are the positives and negatives:Positives:* Material is of a good thickness. Not too thin, not too heavy.* I have found I don't need to iron these.* Deep pockets* Comfortable, soft material* Only slim pants that I have found that look great on me. I don't look skinny in these.Negatives:* The material seriously attracts fluff. This seems to go away after a few washes. But before this time you will need the sticky roller every time you use them.* The material will start to fray at the bottom of leg where it rubs on my shoe after about 3-5 months (weekly washing). If not here, something else will start fraying like the belt holders. If this is a concern I recommend only washing these when it is necessary (and not simply every time you use them) to make the pants last longer.Year Later Update: still going strong on these pants and they are yet to fray.Since my original review, Amazon US don't ship to us poor Aussies any longer and our local site doesn't stock these. I really hope Amazon AU get it in soon before I need another pair.Out of sheer madness I walked into a local retailer, which was an experience in itself. Bought a pair of similar looking pants, best price I could find but still more expensive than my Amazon US order (go figure). They ended up being terrible quality and just didn't look good on me. No return allowed for change of mind. So now I use them for car oil change rags.So cheers to you lucky people who can access the awesome inventory of Amazon US and have a thought for us poor bastards down here who are, at the moment, being placed on strict rations.UPDATE Oct 2019:Unfortunately the cut has suddenly changed to a skinny style. The top waist is still the same cut but the lower half has changed where it now hugs your calf muscles and tapers in tight around your ankles.

I checked out Ralph Lauren and they had some cool waxed canvas cargo thing.  G-Star has all kinds of cool cargos as well.  As you can tell I'm not a hiker or outdoorsman.  I'm a Brooklynite in NYC.  I like cool clothes.  6ft2 I look good in my clothes.  Anyway, so I'm not satisfied with G-Star, Ralph Lauren, or any of the big brands that I normally buy.  Why?  Cos as expensive and cool looking as they are, they wear somewhat quick, especially around the crotch.  I'm tired of buying clothes all the time.So after a small search low and behold I run across this fine company Fjällräven and decided to get the Greenland Jeans.  Yeah I studied them online, checked out the fit, reviews, etc.  But I'm a different kind of guy then most people who buy them... my first thought is style.  Second durability.  Last cost.I got the Greenland Jeans and wow! They''re like Ralph Lauren, G-Star and anyone else, but just tough.  I love the fit.  And I actually wear them in more business casual situations, with a blazer and stuff.  Then I thought, what about these Vidda Pro trousers I was eyeing?Got 'em and haven't looked back.  These things are like a cross between cargo/chino, moto trousers, and outdoor toughguy trousers.  The fit is just perfect.  It's slightly baggier than the Greenland Jeans, but very proportional with all the pockets helping out.  The bonus is the adjustable bottom ankle cuff.  I where them a lot with cool loafers, slightly tapered in.  Then I can wear them with danner boots and the cuff all the way open.  And guys... the ladies LOVE THEM!!  Seriously the girls check 'em out and the guys are always wondering where these cool pants come from.So in a nutshell... just get the pants.  Very light weight and stylish to the height of being stylish.  I can tell that I'll have these and the Greenland Jeans for a super duper long time.  Boom!"", 'I did quite a bit of research before landing on these.....and so far I”m glad I did.  Bought them mainly as a hiking pant, at least for now, and while they have just arrived, they certainly seem to be a well made and well engineered pant.  I also spent quite a bit of time looking at these  reviews to make a call on size.  In sum, I am 6’5”, 215, with a 36/37 waist, and a 36 length in jeans.  I got the 54 long, and fit for both is nearly perfect.  I say nearly because ideally both would be just a hair smaller, but I am certainly fine with as is, and no plans on my part to return.  As these wear in, I may come back to update on what I experience for durability, which is the only reason right now I haven’t given 5 stars.', 'I\'m 6ft and got the long version but they are a bit too long, so bear that in mind. I think you\'ll need to be 6\'2"" for the long. Thankfully you can turn them up so not a bother for me. They are slightly water resistant out of the bag, but wont stand up to prolonged kneeling on saturated ground, so if you are going to do that, get the Greenland Wax applied first, then they are completely waterproof.The dark olive colour is closer to brown than green in the cold light of day, but that is fine by me.They are comfy, stitching seems excellent, pockets everywhere, and seem made to last a lifetime. I suspect my knee joints will wear out before these trousers do.', 'Excellent trousers. Reasonably lightweight yet not thin. Really robust material and breathable with waterproof bottom and knee panelling. Material is also slightly stretchy which makes for a lot more comfort over competitors who trade ruggedness for lack of stretch.Pockets positioned perfectly around any phage and harnesses I wear and very cleverly shifted forward around the thigh. A little touch which makes SUCH a big difference for ease of accessibility. There are plenty of pockets of varying sizes without any being too large that they’re cumbersome. Length is perfect - regular comes with extra length to come well over your boot and lace hooks are brass so won’t rust. Further, there is still diffident length to accommodate squatting without any pull.I am personally not a fan of waterproof trousers, I haven’t needed them and just get too hot in them. These trousers are Greenland Wax compatible so it’s nice to have the option of making them waterproof if needed, at the sacrifice of breathability. Rub it on, wash it off in a normal 40 degree wash. But in my experience thus far, they are sufficiently breathable to quickly dry off and don’t hold much water making them comfortable for very wet walks.Sizing runs small - I went for a 52 (36”) when I’m usually a 50 (34”)', 'Good quality but if you not have a chiseled physique might find issue fitting around waist, no stretch and not do long in all sizes.

My ambulance company kind of puts down anything that looks remotely try-hard. Often people just buy navy blue dickies and call it good. These do the job without hearing grumbles from the ""salty"" folks. The only issue I\'ve had was these were both longer and wider than I expected. As a result, I spent nearly the cost of the pants having them hemmed and taken in - which also meant I had to take in the leg opening too as I could have made a solid parachute out of them. Since the waist is already so stretchy, my advice to you guys is to order a size or two smaller than you would normally expect. I have found over time with Propper products that the sizes are not universal amongst all their products. For instance, you can go from the BDU pants to the Tac light pants to the EMS pants and no pant will fit the same way in the same size (I\'ve bought all three).']"

The material itself is reminiscent of both winter and summer weight American BDU's. A little heavier than summer weights, and isn't rip stop material, but does have the feel of winter weights without being quite as heavy. Their a happy medium. They do wrinkle, just the right amount if that's the look that you like, but nothing a touch of a quick iron can't handle.As for their bagginess I think they are perfect in this arena as well. Not overly so that you can't rock some Chuck Taylor's or Van's with them, and not underly so that they look weird with Osiris or DC's. They also have the built in blousing straps if you want to wear them with jump/combat boots. However, I'v always found using external straps, or just tucking them in to be more comfortable, easy, and look better.I am overwhelmingly happy with these cargo pants. They met my wants and needs, and exceeded my expectations. Dilivery time was even much faster than was estimated, and customer satisfaction is important enough for them to send an email to follow up on my purchase. I think that for the price this is an excellent and awesome product. I will definitely suggest them to my friends and personally buy from them again."", ""I purchased these pants because the style was going to work for what I was doing. I washed them before wearing them and discovered that in the washer and dryer the crotch stitching had come undone.Inspecting it, it looks like the fabric folded when they were sewing it on the machine and so only part of that section was actually stitched. Inspecting the pants further I found a couple of other spots where the stitching was incomplete and seems were coming undone.If I had bought these for everyday wear I would have sent them back and immediately, however I bought them for a cosplay and was going to weather them anyway, so I simply restitched those spots by hand and made it part of the weathering of the pants to make them look more worn.They might be good otherwise if there were no stitching issues, they were comfortable. The fabric was easy to sew back, but if you buy them I would turn them inside out and check the seams for weak points or sewing errors. I found three places it looks like either the fabric folded so they didn't get the stitching right, or where it looks like the machine ran out of thread and they worker just decided to finish them up anyway,"", ""I really like these pants.  They are big, and baggy, but that's what I love about them.  The one thing that is kind of weird, is the length.  I mean, I am 6'1 and the legs completely cover my feet - and then go another 2 or 3 inches.  I don't care about the ankle ties, so I pulled them out and brought them over to my dry cleaner guy to get about 5 or 6 inches hemmed off the legs.  Now they are perfect.  So, if you are about 6'5, or 6'8 these are the perfect length.  If not, I hope your town has a decent tailor, or you are gonna be walking around with some bunched up pants at your ankles."", ""These pants are super comfortable. They're baggy and the people who have said they are kind of long are not wrong. They come with the longest waist drawstring I've ever seen on pants! I like them but biggest complaint is that they are not black/white/gray as they look in the picture. They are definitely brown."", 'These pants were so good I’ve stayed to the brand and style since 2013, I’ve found them to be very comfortable and hard wearing, great for working in, sitting around or even smart casual, until my last 2 purchases, I put the previous pair down to - well you’ve had so many your bound to get a hiccup, the last one though was just plain bad workmanship, buttons fell off, the tie cords have snapped off, even the material feels different. I do not feel as if they have the same hard wearability the previous seem to have. This pair are terrible and along with the last pair being not up to previous standards I will not be purchasing another pair.']"

Requested Zoulee by email to introduce more colors which they responded back saying they would soon. This has turned out to be one of the best comfortable products I have bought in many years.End of Update 2.12.19For the past many years I have been looking for Sweatpants that are (a) Good Quality (b) Comfort fit with some good room in the crotch area, i.e. moderate to high rise instead of the sickening low rise pants that have half the world showing their bottom crack in sitting positions (c) Has Front Fly Zipper (d) Can wear to WorkThe few I found in the market were either very poor quality or extremely expensive.  I had been passing through this Zoulee\'s sweatpant page quite a few times, but the kind of sizing they displayed for this product made me skeptical, but in the end decided to give it a try.I ordered the M size for my waist size of 35"". Something didn\'t seem right, so I emailed Zoulee and they immediately replied back that they will swap the size as the S size would be the better fit for me.The pants came in this morning (a few weeks later) and I am very very impressed. Sweat pants quality? Check, Awesome Mix of Cotton and Nylon with some stretch in the fabric. Comfort fit? Check. It has enough room in the rise to comfortably sit high on my waist. Snug fit at the waist and comfort straight fit down below. Wear to Work? Check. They simply drape like a regular formal pant - I think the nylon and the way the fabric is cut does the trick. Bonus points: They don\'t wrinkle in the few hours I have worn them like cotton or linenAnd finally Fly Front Zipper? BIG CHECK. Yes, these pants DO HAVE ZIPPER FLY. The other two reviews said ""no zipper fly"" so I emailed Zoulee again to make sure these pants had zipper fly. They replied back confirming their pants hat front fly zipper and were helpless and did not understand why two reviewers said their pants did not have zippers. I felt sorry for Zoulee and more so now, seeing the super quality of their pants and the fact that they do have zipper front fly.Will update this review in a few months to see how the quality of pant survives the wear and tear and look for pilling etc.', 'Very heavy weight.....bought for the zipper feature.
