Idk.These are most likely 100% cotton as claimed so they WILL shrink! I find the larger the shirt size the more they will shrink relative to their size. So plan accordingly.A common complaint is that they‚Äôre itchy. All I can say is WASH BEFORE WEARING as you should be anyways. Ever heard of demodex mites?

They may be only 6 oz. or ..maybe,  a blend?  I didn't try them on. I didn't even take the two which arrived yesterday out of the zippered plastic bags they were shipped in.

There is only a small label that says  ‚ÄúDesigned in Italy‚Äù, once more!Hold on‚Äî I wanted to double check the other- the laundry label.  It doesn‚Äôt  id the brand either.  For all we know these are just  cheap knock-0ffs, or, maybe, ‚ÄúDesigned in Italy‚Äù is the brand not Alimens & Gentle.  ?  The only place the brand is id‚Äôd is on the sticker label on the outside of the plastic zippered bag.

Why...?1) Not tagless, but tags removed easily w/simple tear2) Heavier duty, but NOT too heavy [I sweat so I need ones that soak it up preventing it from showing to top layer + not as thick as the HEAVY version which can be too much]. The thickness also provides a better form fit under your top layers [not sticking to those unflattering curves for us non-super models] and helps to create a sold shapely base for the top layers.3] Still TBA but so far I believe these will hold up longer than versions advertised as undershirts which are so thin the stain easy, wrinkle, and provide no shape. The thinner version sinks into cracks and crevasses typically taking the top layers with it creating an unflattering look.4] Sleeves stay in place [as undershirt, as opposed to the thinner ones that constantly roll up under your top layers, ultimately [at least for me] requiring constant readjustment.5] Looking forward to confirming but I've been finding the thinner version advertised as undershirts typically require replacement [bleach won't return them to white once pit stains wear in which eventually start show through when wearing thinner or light colored top layers], the overall feel and quality of this version have me anticipating a much longer shelf life [and I'm one who wears them daily under all wardrobe combinations.6] They're GILDAN, and as brand loyal customer, I can say hands down I've never find a more reasonably priced brand that delivers quality like Gildan does!!!

The only slightly odd thing is the neck is a little big, even after washing, but not a deal-breaker.  Finding the right size is tricky. I am 6\'1""and 180 lbs. and I think my ideal size is Large Tall.  I bought XL and it fits okay after washing, but the LT is better for my build. They do shrink a little after washing.  I washed in cold then low heat dryer. I bought 3 of these shirts. It\'s nice that they have the options for large, tall but the trick is figuring out what will be right for you after you\'ve washed the shirt.Update: 12/17/22  I just ordered another XL of these shirts. I wish they would get in the Denim Blue Melange and the Oatmeal Melange.  I compared the new unwashed XL to 3 washed and dried on warm many times after a year XL\'s and 1 Large Tall LT.  See photos.The sleeves shrink just under 3 inches. The LT is longer in body but not in sleeves. The XL\'s are roomy around chest and waist. I like that, I think most guys nowadays would want it to be snugger. I prefer the room, but the shirt does look big on me. I don\'t care, it feels great. I wear it over a T-shirt and depending on the weather, button it or leave it unbuttoned, it looks and feels great.You have to wash these and dry them to see what their real size is going to wind up being.  At around $40 a shirt, it\'s an expensive experiment. It wouldn\'t even matter if you could find these in a store and try them on in person because the size changes so much after you wash them.  I think the neck opening is still big no matter what.  It\'s strange in spite of all these size issues, this is still such a quality shirt.  They are so comfortable. I just wish they had the colors I wanted.  Of course that ugly green one is always available. Sorry to the guys who bought the ugly,... I mean the stylish green one.Originally I said the LT was my ideal size and I think if someone else were looking at me wearing it, it would look better but the XL feels more comfy.  And I usually reach for the XL\'s.The XL\'s shrink by almost 3 inches in the sleeves and only by about 2 inches in the chest after being washed and dried on warm. These have a free returns policy so you could buy a few different sizes and imagine them a few inches shorter in the sleeves and in the torso. Long sizes are about two inches longer only in the torso.  I didn\'t notice much difference in the sleeves but then again I compared XL to LT, not XLT.  I knew that once I washed them I couldn\'t return them.  If you wash two and one fits and the other one doesn\'t, they make good gifts.For reference the XL\'s are the:  Copper Canyon Plaid(not washed and dried yet) All the rest have been washed and dried many times:  Midnight Army Plaid, Horizon Plaid and the Large Tall is the: Forest Moss Plaid.  The Copper Canyon Plaid and the Horizon Plaid are similar but the Copper is much darker.The light green one called Forest Moss Plaid is the only Large Tall, the other three are XL\'s. After being washed and shrinking they all fit on my wrist perfectly. They just barely cover the heel of my palm and if I raise my arms my wrist is still covered. Again, I\'m 6\'1""']"

Oh well. Then I remembered: the chambray shirt!Whoa! Literally... Back in the day, when we had a ranch and I used to ride a horse around the boondocks at every possible chance, Phoenix used to host a store called Yellow Front. An odd emporium, it had features of a general store, a Sportsman\'s Warehouse, and a blue-collar worker\'s supply. I bought a pair of saddlebags for Babe there -- very handy! And jeans and bandannas and fishing gear and a felt-covered canteen and...all sorts of cool stuff.One of the cool things you could get there were men\'s blue chambray work shirts. They were cotton plus some kind of synthetic, as I recall -- so you didn\'t have to iron the damn things, the way you had to iron your daddy\'s khaki shirts once a week. And they were the bidness! Loose-fitting even in the smallest men\'s size (which was the only size that would even remotely fit a 120-pound woman), they let air flow all around you (if you left the tails untucked) and so, much like an Arab\'s white robes, would keep you cool on a warm day by blocking the direct sun while creating a kind of natural air-conditioning.Yellow Front, like all things American and Good, is long gone. In the past I\'ve looked for the things at joints like Target and Walmart and found them...disappeared. Hmmm... chambray chAMbray chAMAZONbray! Why the heck not?Off to the Web! Look it up, and lo! Wrangler still makes them!!! And Amazon has got them!HOT diggety DAYum!Order one up. Late this morning, stroll out to the front courtyard to imbibe the remains of the day\'s coffee, and lo! There\'s a package from Amazon. Grab. Rip open. And lo! There\'s a good old chambray shirt.This one\'s fabric is a little heavier gauge than the ones I recall. It\'s 100% cotton. And instead of being made somewhere in New England or the Midwest, it\'s fabriqu√© in Bangladesh, which is too bad. Shame on Wrangler! Still...at least they\'re still making them and shipping them to...Amazon. Yeah.And the ""small"" size does still fit. A little long in the arms, which as I recall was the case with the original. I used to roll up the sleeves, aping a handsome young man whose style I admired. For an old lady\'s purposes, though, this is...umh, handy, because when left to their own whim, the cuffs slide down past your wrists and cover about half the back of your hand, thereby protecting the supposedly precancerous area from the dreaded sun.This kind of shirt makes a great lounge-around-the-house cover-up when the weather\'s cold, too. I don\'t run the heat in the winter -- saving the power then makes it marginally affordable to run the air conditioning in the summertime. So what\'s needed here at the Funny Farm is something to keep off the chill that can be run through the washer and is not too fancy to wear while gardening and cleaning the pool and scrubbing down the kitchen and is sturdy enough to hold up to said activities. For the summer: all of the above, except substitute ""keep off the sun"" for the first desideratum.Just the ticket.Heh. Wrangler. I used to wear Wranglers jeans. That was SO outr√©! Lawyers\' wives did not wear Wranglers. No, nooo, dear, it was just not done! At the worst, you could wear Levis, but even that...tsk tsk. If it cost less than $50, it was just...no.Well, being the sassy little broad that I was, of course I wore Wranglers, because the things fit. Levis do not fit a 120-pound woman with a 130-pound rear-end. :-D Do not now, did not then, never will. Wranglers would fit real women, and they fit women who were given to riding horses. Not only could you breathe in the things, you could swing your leg up over a saddle and push yourself clear of a horse that was going down or trying to throw you. Not only did I wear the things, I wore them to teach in graduate school. So there!Think I\'ll order up a few more of these fine garments. Now...if only I could get ahold of another mare...', 'Good fitting, not to thick, not to thin. No wrinkle. Got 2 green and a gray. No problems with any of them. Tails don‚Äôt come untucked']"

Runs large.', 'I am wearing the Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt right now. It has a ribbed collar and flat-seamed sleeves.WHAT I LIKE:The fit is exactly the same as every other Hanes polo I have worn ‚Äî just order your usual American size. It‚Äôs a standard, traditional fit ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt elastic, form-fitting, or clinging. The polyester fabric is very light and cool with a finish that is smooth, not meshy or lumpy. The finish is a little slippery, but that‚Äôs not a problem for me. I ordered black, which is very dark and opaque (not see-through). The price was very reasonable.I wash the Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt in biodegradable detergent on regular cycle with tap-cold water and maximum spin, and the shirt comes out wrinkle-free. Then I hang it on a plastic hanger on the shower rod and it is dry in a few hours. So that‚Äôs minimal care in my book.If you want to travel with the Hanes shirt, it packs light and hasn‚Äôt wrinkled, yet. If you want a shirt you can rinse out and hang up to dry overnight, this is it.WHAT I DON‚ÄôT LIKE SO WELL:The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the short sleeves are a little long, reaching to the middle of my elbows. I was going to send it back over the sleeves, but trusted advisors tell me that it looks fine. So, if it looks fine, it‚Äôs OK with me.DURABILITY:I have been testing my Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt by wearing all the time by itself and under a sweater or jacket for warmth. So far, my shirt has not shrunk, wrinkled, snagged, or pilled ‚Äî the seams are still sewn tight. I wish I had longer term durability data for you, but then you couldn‚Äôt be reading my review now.ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES:Hanes Cool Dri polo shirts are made of synthetic polyester with no elastic fibers (like Lycra or Elastane). Polyester fabric is strong, clean, slightly absorbent, slightly shrinkable, and can be recycled. Lots of polyester is recycled from plastic water bottles, so that‚Äôs a good thing. Unfortunately, polyester is not very biodegradable (land fill estimate=100 years), although some bacteria and lichen have been found that degrade them. My Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt was made in El Salvador.RECOMMENDATIONS:Right now, I‚Äôm recommending Hanes Cool Dri polo shirts if you want a super light, inexpensive shirt and don‚Äôt mind the sleeves a little long. If I change my mind or my Hanes polyester polo develops problems, I‚Äôll publish an UPDATE on my Amazon profile page (just click my name).You‚Äôre welcome to read more of my reviews, check for UPDATES, & follow my profile ‚Äî click my name, above.I hope this review has saved you time and has been really helpful.

It does better than my faux fur and leather coat at making me feel warm, so 10/10 on being a winter sweater.My sister also bought one(black), and the sewing on her sleeves was a little shabby because of the nature of trying to sew two things together without taking a million years to make sure they're perfectly aligned.

If you can mend this sweater does not take a lot of effort to make it have a more custom fit, and it's well designed.

On top of that it offered good wind protection as long as the mask stayed in place.Waterproofing: It helped me stay dry for sure, but the snow that accumulated on top would freeze of course becayse of the cold conditions.

The 361 (since replaced with the 363) have a similar cut as the 221 but less stretch.  The denim is also a little thicker, which is a huge bonus. The 221's are comfy, but don't really feel like jeans because of the thinner denim. One note on these: They look like more of a boot cut than what you see in the photos.  I don't really mind because I wear a lot of boots, but I would have preferred a straighter leg at the bottom.  Overall, thicker/better denim than the 221, less stretch (but still some) and a nice fit.  If you're between sizes, always go down a size.  Lucky Brand is very generous with their waist sizes.  I may order a couple more of these to tuck away for later because I like them so much and they've been discontinued."", 'Per the Lucky You jeans ""what to look for"" list, these jeans are fake.

As many Levi\'s loyalists know, however, as of the last few years the Levi\'s brand has gone to hell and different pairs of the same size and model may fit a few different ways, depending on when and where you buy them.  That said, I still prefer the leaner--while not tight--fit and look of the 565 and still wear these when I\'m out on the town, wearing a collared shirt, wearing nicer but non-formal footwear (cowboy boots, slip on loafers, etc.).There is one place, however, where I do NOT want my jeans leaner and tighter and a little dressier, and that\'s AT WORK.  I oversee management and maintenance operations for a commercial/residential real estate division, and that means I can dress somewhat casually (jeans, polo shirt, utility boots) and can also expect to get dirty on some days of the week.  If I\'m going to be in these all day long, I want something comfortable.  I turned my nose at Wrangler for many years, but I realize the error of my ways now:  these Wranglers are the most comfortable jeans I\'ve ever worn.They\'re somewhat baggy--maybe in the ballpark of the Levi\'s 569--but the cut is very different.  More space all around but they\'re also shaped in a way that allows more freedom of movement.  I also wear a lot of tactical cargo pants at work, and these Wranglers are similar.Also, I don\'t know how they accomplish this on brand new jeans, but they come feeling like jeans I\'ve been breaking in for years.  Every guy has one or two pairs of jeans that he\'s had for longer than he can remember; the ones you wear on a lazy, hung-over Sunday afternoon; the ones you throw on when you\'re going out to nowhere special and the only thing you care about is being comfortable.  These are those jeans.Again, these are not pretty jeans.  I wouldn\'t wear them on a date on Friday night with a button-up shirt, ECCOs slip-on loafers and a nice watch.  I certainly wouldn\'t wear them to a nicer restaurant.  But with a black work polo shirt, utility steel-toe boots, Casio G-SHOCK and twelve hours of work ahead of me, there are few choices better than Wrangler.']"

If you need to present a casual look but maintain a very minimal level of functionality, you cannot go wrong with these.The main problem was, all the ""other"" tactical jeans were ""straight"" or ""classic"" fit. So when I tried those on I looked like I raided my wifes skinny jeans from her closet. Not only is slim fit unprofessional looking, it really restricts movement and you can\'t fit anything in your pockets, unless you want to put your smartphone in your back pocket the way your teenage daughter does. For whatever reason, the makers of these tactical jeans just were not understanding that the average wearer of these is probably going to have larger thighs, hamstrings, and calves, disproportionate to their smaller waist size.So that brings me to the first part of the review where I will actually talk about these jeans. Vertx had the good sense to make these relaxed fit, not straight fit or classic fit or your wife\'s jeggings fit. Now I will say they could still be just a tad bit looser in the upper leg, as I went up a size from my normal relaxed fit jeans and although I am swimming in the waist of the jeans, they fit properly around my upper legs without being overly tight or baggy. I can put something in my front pockets and its not printing through my pants like I\'m wearing spandex. The leg opening is a good width, again I prefer a little bit wider leg opening at the cuff, but these still do not look like the ""other"" jeans out there where the leg is the same width all the way to the cuff and just looks silly. So although I would prefer these to be just a little more relaxed than they are, no other jeans out there can compare. So I recommend going one size up. (For reference, I\'m 6\' tall 220lbs.)I am a fan of the material, these jeans appear durable but have some slight stretch to them, all without feeling too soft and flimsy or like traditional denim that is heavy and takes a day and half to dry when wet. I\'ve only worn them a couple times so far out and about, so I can\'t speak to how much punishment they\'ll actually take. However they seem well made.The colors are a bit of an interesting choice. You can choose from dark wash or dark stonewash. I got one of each and honestly they look pretty similar to me. If anyone from Vertx ever reads this, PLEASE make a light (read: very light) wash version of these! This is a trend I noticed with all the other tactical jeans out there: for some reason dark wash is the only color available. Even in regular jeans I have no idea why light wash is so hard to find.The price is maybe a little high for these, but they are worth it and I would buy them again (especially if Vertx tweaked them the way I mentioned).In summary:-These are the closest to a true ""relaxed fit"" you are going to find in a tactical jean--I went a size up and I\'m glad I did (wish they were just a little looser in the leg!). If you tend to skip leg day, you could probably go with your regular waist size.-The leg opening is wide enough that you can wear it with high top boots and not look like a dweeb (again, not asking for bootcut width but a little wider on the leg opening would be perfect!)-Pockets are placed well and offer good functionality, while maintaining a low visual profile-Limited color selection is limited (make a light wash version!)-Price is on the high side of fair, so I\'ll slowly replace my old jeans with these over time', 'the waist is like 2 sizes bigger than the size you recieve and i dont understand the diaper crotch‚Ä¶you have to have a badonka donk for these to fit you comfortablely', 'These are by far the best jeans I have ever owned. They are incredibly comfortable and provide ample carrying conveniences. Definitely worth the money, and I highly recommend them to anyone who expects their jeans to work for them.']"

More comfortable as well. Second, the cargo pockets have an extra pocket with open top to tuck your cellphone or a clip-style pocketknife into. Third, on the outside of the cargo pocket there is a small velcro pocket, not found on the original BDU pants. Fourth, inside the waistband is an inner button closure. This is in addition to the heavy-duty snap closure. The button is a traditional BDU pants button, which is a nice touch. Other points... The quality of the fabric is very good, nice and not too heavy, with nice stitching.. There is also a purpose-made knife pocket just behind the front pocket near the side seam, it fits my small pocketknife but may be a bit too small some of the larger folders. This is my new standard for shorts... I'll probably buy 2-3 more pairs and get rid of all my worn out BDU shorts. In case you didn't figure it out, I highly recommend these shorts. I purchased these with my own money, and I receive no renumeration for this review."", ""These were gifts for the men in my family who work outdoors in the summer and wear through shorts frequently. All the pairs purchased are still going strong a couple years later, no fraying or fading. I keep ordering more when they are on sale for more pairs in the wash rotation. They don't stain easily, are lightweight and cool. One pair of these equals 5 pairs of traditional khakis for my husband and the pockets are more suited to his use. Definitely recommend."", ""Review of the Khaki Color: I've owned my first pair of these for nearly seven years. Lost my second pair. Just bought a third pair. My first pair I wear every day. I wear them baggy like with high top sneakers baggy. I bought the new pair in the same color because theres a obvious stain on my first pair recently. I hike, bike ride, run, do parkour, rock climb, work on my car, and done many different highly physically strenuous jobs in my shorts... For seven years... They are loaded up with many edc items in all pockets. Theres one tiny hole in my keys pocket. Which has been my keys pocket since i bought my first pair... After seven years. These are set and forget. Wear them to any occasion you would put shorts on for literally any. Appropriate for all occasions from rock climbing to Job interviews. My first pair will continue to be my daily drivers for years. This new pair is just for when i want to look a little nicer. Wish I could get a pair of shoes to last this long.**oh, and the phone pocket behind the cargo pocket is new. It reduces functionality of the cargo pocket. Can no longer use one of the Magazine dividers for my 3-in-1 defense spray without causing the phone slip behind the pocket to deform visibly. Ive adjusted my carry but now in order to get the clean lines i feel the papper spray rub against the side of my knee. With my first pair i always forget i even have anything in my pockets theyre so awesome.""]"

I have worn the shorts for about 34 days our of my 40 days of study abroad and exploration of Europe and they have gone above and beyond my expectations. Here's why:1) They are comfortable (not basketball shorts comfortable) but still pretty damn comfortable. I've walked roughly 25-50 miles over my trip so far and these bad boys felt great. A little stretchy and good length in my opinion just covering the knees or slightly above the knees how I like my shorts.2) They don't small (normally this wouldn't be an issue but when you are backpacking through Europe you don't always have a place to wash your clothes. I honestly think I could have gone the whole trip without washing this (I didn't test that theory through) I washed these about once a week, but even after a week of heavy walking no odor at all.3) They look good. These are no dress shorts (are there such a thing?) but they look great with a button up and tennies.4) The lower side button pockets are great for holding whatever you need and I never lost anything from them during the trip even when sitting, standing, running, etc.Improvements:There are awesome shorts and I plan to pick up one other in another color but HH could improve them still.1) Side pockets don't work well (not sure if they could make them deeper or reshape them) but they just don't do the job. Nothing really fits and when small thins do fit they would fall out most times I sat down.2) They take longer to dry than I had hoped. I wanted these to be shorts I could wear to the river or beach and be dry by the hike back but they take over a day or two (depending on temperature) to completely air dry. Not a big deal but if you are reading this HH you could make these bad boys even better.3) Back zip pocket is great for documents small paper (very flat stuff) but doesn't work for much else. It's also very long which is a little strange (no complaints) just think it could be better somehow.Well there you have it these are the best multiple purpose shorts I have owned to date in my 27 years on this earth and I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking. They seem like they could last forever with proper wash and dry care and I look forward to test this out by wearing them even when I return from backpacking.Great job HH thumbs up over here."", 'Great fit and very comfortable!']"

Fit perfect, appear very well made."", 'Live, work and play in a South Florida subtropical climate. These lightweight, comfortable, versatile and highly functional shorts fit the bill perfectly for this challenging, high heat/humidity environment. Working in a law enforcement capacity, I have purchased many  5.11 brand products (nearly all from AMAZON) for work/play and have been extremely pleased with the high quality, durability and performance from all of these purchases in the field. These shorts are no exception and I am extremely pleased with how they look, feel and perform in the field.The well designed and laid out 8 pockets of these shorts allow for efficient organization/storage of all of your tactical/field gear (knives, flashlights, cell phones, magazines). The 4 slash pockets (2  front shallow with velcro security and 2 rear with deeper length) allow for quick and easy access to your gear.  The rear trademarked tactical canvas strap and front D-ring allows you additional attachment points for other gear you want to access quickly. The heavy duty, double bartacked large belt loops allow extra durability to use various tactical belts (prefer 5.11 in this area too) to effectively support/carry your gear.The fit and feel of these shorts is nearly perfect and I feel is true to size.  I wear a Medium 32-34 in most shorts and purchased size 34 in the Khaki color and they look and fit me great. I am just shy of 6\' and 175 lbs. and the 9.5"" inseam fits me just above my knees similar to the picture. As other reviewers have commented, they are not completely form fitting, close to your body but somewhat loose fitting - especially in the crotch (probably due to the built in double reinforced triangular gusseted material) but they are not baggy looking unlike other brands of tactical shorts and pants I have purchased.  In short, they are designed to be loose in the areas you want to allow for extra freedom of movement and form fitting in other areas.If you do not like the fit and appearance from the 9.5"" leg length you may want to order the 11"" inseam for more leg coverage.  The action elastic comfort stretch band in the waist allows for a little extra expansion for movement and for an IWB CCW (small weapon) and or a heavy meal!  The poly/cotton 6.14 oz. ripstop fabric is very durable and lightweight and nearly wrinkle-free. The Dupont Teflon stain protector keeps them from becoming easily stained in the field. I also use them as hiking/trekking shorts and they perform beautifully and are the best I have found for this purpose.I do not know of any UPF factor on these shorts for those who are concerned about sun safety. Due to polyester fabric blend of these shorts,  I would say the sun protection factor they provide is fairly high - at least UPF 30 - but this is just a guess on my part based on other similar blended UPF fabric shorts/pants that I have purchased. This is an issue for me and a factor in buying due to subtropical climate in which I live and work and maximum sun exposure to harmful UVA/UVB rays in this type of environment.Other great and high quality features are the YKK zippers and PYRM snap in the fly area and the cordura reinforced pocket edges to prevent the pockets from tearing when you attach your knife or flashlight in these areas.In summary, I truly believe the Taclite Pro Shorts from 5.11 are the ""best of breed"" as far as tactical shorts brands go and are probably the most perfectly designed, functional and highly performing shorts that I have ever purchased.Additionally, they are extremely comfortable to wear and are made from a lightweight breathable fabric which performs excellently in a warm, humid climate.  If you need something heavier and warmer I recommend their regular tactical shorts which I believe has a 8.5 ounce fabric.While they are not inexpensive- AMAZON - has the best pricing, I believe in the motto "" you get what you pay for"" and I think this truly applies to this product. I highly recommend them to you for use in the field or in tactical, warm weather climate. I know I will be purchasing several additional pairs (different colors) in the near future.', ""Normally wear a 40 but had to get 44s...originally got 42 but they are really snug in the thighs (I'm 6'3, 300 lbs.).""]"

I wanted to get a green Harrys tweed vest. Mostly, I was looking for a heavy vest to help with the winter in Missouri. So far, none of the options have a Harrys tweed logo.The Irish Celtic Ranch weights 10 1/2 oz. =290grsThe Vaboom weights 11 1/2oz =326grsThe Onlylover weight 11oz 313grs, which is surprising since it has a satin back.The Emerald Isle was the heaviest with 11 5/8oz =329grs. Its has tweed on front and back and is the only  one that came with an extra button.None of these vest have internal pockets. The Irish Celtic and the Emerald Isle have 4 external pockets, which is nice. All pockets are closed, just use a needle to open them up. Avoid using a pair of scissors, you don‚Äôt want to risk cutting the fabric by mistake.The Onlylover and the Voboom can be stretched  by pulling the two straps on the back (see photo). Unfortunately, the Irish Celtic and the Emerald Isle have only one strap to pull on the back, which means you get half of the stretch.Onlylover seems wider than the other two, specially by the shoulders. Irish Celtic and Voboom had the same wide. See picture comparing Onlylover with Irish Celtic.Except for Onlylover, they all have 5 buttons on the front. Only lover has an extra button located possibly to hold a pocket watch.Reading the reviews on all these products, I thought getting a small size would fit me well enough. Most people complained about the vests being too small. Well, none of these vests are small enough to fit me. I guess reviews depend on the eyes of the beholder.', ""Love the vest. Bought it for a wedding and got it at the last minute. Was really hoping it would fit well and it did. I removed the little threads that hold the front pockets shut and it was easy enough to do. The material is nice, and thick, so it doesn't feel cheap. The stitching is strong and not cheezy. I told my wife that being a person who values quality, I've worn it with a feeling of pride.

He usually takes a 38 coat and 33 pant so I decided to give this suit a try.  Let's take a look.HOW THIS COMESThis comes on a really nice hanger that holds the suit shape nicely.  It is covered with a high quality clear plastic bag over top too for hanging and keeping it dust free.FABRICThe fabric of this suit is beautiful.  It has the wrinkle free texture of poly, but the soft drape and flow of the viscose.  It is a VERY fine twill weave.COLORThe color is a beautiful charcoal gray.STYLEThe style is really nice.  It is a silmmer cut, so if you are more prone to the beefier American cut, this suit might not work for you.  If you are the type who is looking for a flattering European cut, this suit might be just the right style for you.COATThe coat has pockets sewn shut (you will have to take out the stitching when you want to wear this as is customary with tailored clothing).  They are well made and at a good angle and size.  There are three inside pockets which are also beautifully made and styled into the inside of the coat.LININGThe lining of this coat is beautifully sewn.  In some parts, the lining is hand sewn into place, adding a real beautiful touch to this jacket.  The sleeves are lined in white, and the quality of the lining is professional quality.PANTSThe pants have 2 buttons and a hook on them.  There is an inside button and outside.  There are slash pockets which are deep enough not to have things falling out.  The back pockets will have to be opened as they are temporarily stitched shut as with most tailored clothing.  The bottoms of the legs are unfinished and you have to have them hemmed.  The back at the waist has the capacity to expand bigger by about an inch and a quarter or so.FITMy husband usually wears a 38 regular coat and 33 pants. He has a little tummy now, where he used to be very flat and European cut all of the way.  This suit is a bit snug on him as far as the coat goes, but the pants have plenty of room in them and can be made bigger if needed.  This suit is very flattering and cut well.  We got a 40R and the pants are 34w.THE BOTTOM LINEThis suit is an excellently sewn suit.  It is really beautifully made.  The fabric is very nice and the quality of construction is high end.  It is definitely a slim suit, but it is well made and styled.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  This suit is a bit slim for my husband but we will make it work.  It is well made and the style is great.PHOTOSI have taken many photos of the suit, but could not get my husband to model it yet.  If I do, I will try to add those photos to this review soon.  I wanted to get it posted because this suit deserves to be looked at and considered.  The last photo I posted is of the center back seam in the pants so you can see how much there is to expand if needed."", 'QUICK SUMMARY: I selected 44R / 38W but I\'m 6\' 2"" tall. My bad, I should\'ve ordered the 44 Tall. So the suit coat is too short, the suit coat sleeves are too short. I can\'t downgrade my star rating because I ordered the wrong size, though. I gave it 4-stars because it would be better to have the pant length be hemmed rather than unhemmed, because of the expense and extra effort to get the pants hemmed to whatever you want.WHAT I LIKE:- The black suit coat and pants were what I expected (black, not charcoal)- The suit coat was nicely put together, with inside pockets and nice feel- The 44 coat size fit me as expected- The 38 waist size fit me as expected (tight for a 38-inch waist, but it is a ""slim fit"" product)WHAT I DIDN""T LIKE:- I didn\'t like the way the slim fit pants felt on my upper thighs. Something about how it\'s sewn together makes it feel weird on my legs. I don\'t usually buy slim fit items, though, so it\'s probably a function of how the pants are sewn for a tight, athletic fit.- If the waist size of the pants is a function of the suit coat, you might as well take a guess at the length of the pants and have them come hemmed rather than unhemmed. No matter what your pant length is, you have an extra expense and effort to get your pants hemmed (unless you\'ve got a family member, friend or significant other who\'s willing to do this for you - or if you can do that for yourself).CONCLUSION: I\'m tempted to get the correct-sized item (44 Tall / 38 waist) just to get a cheap suit in my closet for those very few times I need a suit (weddings, funerals). This is great suit for a college student who\'s graduating and needs some wardrobe items for that first in-person interview.']"

Heavy enough for the Fall weather up here in Northern Wisconsin. I am pleased with this purchase...', 'I really want to like this. It does look fairly nice for the price. My wife even liked it.But, looking at this, I kind of expected a tweedy, woven texture to the herringbone fabric. Instead, it is a tufted texture, kind of like velvet or a very low pile wool rug. I won\'t say that this is good or bad. It feels nice. I suspect it won\'t wear very well with a lot of use though.The description of the sizing is dead on. This is the ""standard fit is slim and slim is skinny"" kind of sizing. If that works for you, you  might be fine. In my case, it means the shoulders fit especially poorly, the sleeves are so long it\'s better to return this than tailor it, while the body is fine. I might give it a shot one size down, but I suspect the body might be a bit tighter. Your mileage may vary of course.']"

shoe,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Brb-Q3n-L.__AC_SY395_SX395_QL70_ML2_.jpg,"[""1) ConstructionMy pair seemed to be well built, and light in hand.  I did not notice any rips, cracks or other separations in the components of the shoes. They are moderately flexible, more so if you remove whichever of two style inserts yours came with. (More on that, later)2) FitThe toe box on these is big and roomy, as a good shoe should be.I did notice a tight spot on these shoes, though this might have to do more with my individual physique than with the product:  A slightly tighter fit between the inside tops of my feet and the shoes, especially when wearing thicker than average thickness socks.  I was able to remedy this with a file bit for my drill, and gently filed away about 1mm of material from inside the top of the uppers of both shoes.I can now still wear them comfortably without socks, or, with socks of any thickness.3) On the Move:These are NOT Merrells or Danskos!  But they are an economical alternative with at least 70 percent of the arch and overall support I need at work, or for a mile-long walk around my neighborhood.  I have tested them with and without the included inserts, and have not experienced a whole lot of rubbing in most combinations.  For me, if I go barefoot, I will leave the bottom inserts in.  With my thicker socks, I can wear them with or without the inserts in.  Wearing my thickest Icelandic 30 belows, I can wear them without the inserts, on my leisure days when it is cold outside.I also own Crocs Lite Ride sandals, and can say that Crocs does know 'a thing or two' about orthotic support ergonomics.  And it has translated to the experience in these On The Clock clogs.4) Finally.. The SWEAT Factor!I've read a lot of reviews from wearers who state that their feet got really hot, and or sweaty and smelly in Crocs On The Clock.I would say that is true in my case - but only when wearing my thickest socks - the Icelandic 30 Below wools.  After a few hours in the Crocs/Icelandic combination, when I remove the Crocs, the bottoms of the Icelandics are indeed warm and wet! But not squishy wet.  And that leads me to my final section, regarding the title of this review...5) Two Flavors of On The Clock Clogs:I bought, from this page, the version with the dark spongy support inserts with fabric on top, and with small holes punched through the forward(toe box) section for breathability. That might explain my lack of the squishy-squeaky soaky experience I read in so many reviews here.There is another version, which looks externally exactly like mine, top to sole, but, it has the red or orange? insert that is just plain rubber, and has the same pattern as my aforementioned Crocs Lite Ride flip flops. Now in a shoe like these On The Clocks, even with the small holes they do come with, a solid rubber bottom, or insert if that's what that is, is what I would understand to be a recipe for really irritably hot, sweaty soles, with or without socks!  And that excessive sweat is what can lead to the squaking, pardon my french, 'farty' sounds of a thoroughly drenched foot against the rubber bottom of such a shoe.I would suspect that  most of the excessively 'hot n sweaty' and squeaky complaints are coming from wearers of that version, which I have yet to review.  I may be wrong.  Please let me know, if there is a reply function to these posted reviews.Overall, for under U.S. $50, they are a relatively light, comfortable, and supportive shoe for, as they are named, on the clock at work, or at home or out on the town."", ""I work in several nursing facilities. We've had more COVID outbreaks and cases than I care to mention. I've basically given up wearing business attire and opted for scrubs since I could easily wash them as soon as I got home. I needed shoes that I could sanitize daily and that had non-slip properties. Closed tops were mandatory due to the possibility of spilled chemicals or body fluids.I used the bistro clogs for almost 2 years, but after a recent camping trip, the clogs shrunk a size, so my old clogs were basically for wearing around the house with no socks and for a short time (I can't see throwing them out just yet).  I used my other, personal crocs for a bit, but my infection prevention nurse reminded me that the holes in my other crocs were not sanitary or safe.Luckily, I got an Amazon gift card from my bother-in-law so I ordered these. They fit much better than the bistro clogs with much more width around the toe area. While I liked the convenience of just slipping on the clogs, the closed heel on these gave more support, especially on wet surfaces.I like the cushioned insert and, so far, I haven't had any excessive sweat issues. I have EEE wide feet and only the top of the shoe where it meets the top of my foot is snug. The sides where it meets the sides of my foot are just right. It's snug, too, but not uncomfortable. The toe area, like I said before, is roomy but not large.I bought these for a purpose and it meets my needs just fine. Like my bistro clogs, these will be only for work (I learned the hard way using them for pleasure what happens) and I'm sure I'll get at least a couple of years out of them.

I'm happy with what I paid for what I got, so much so that I bought 6 pair, so I'm good for this winter and the next 5 winters.  I'm tired of companies making something decent and then changing it the next year.  That's why I stocked up.  I double knot the laces and have them on all day and the ranch isn't destroying them right off like some boots.  They have a pretty good grip even on slick surfaces.  As long as my feet stay dry, they stay warm with basic jock socks.  I'm happy.Update 2/19- The stitching isn't holding up and I haven't used them rough.  It's unraveling opposite of the orange insignia where the black meets the leather.  Either the thread is cheap and or any glue/sealant used simply isn't holding and it's separating. One and 1/2 months and the boots are coming apart.  The rest of the boot is fine but snow melts and goes into the boot.  It's Literally right where the bottom lace eyelets are and your foot bends.  It's past where I can return them without getting spanked so I figure I have to raise Cain with Wolverine.  I have 6 pairs of these as I wanted to be set for a few years and didn't anticipate this happening.  This is a fatal flaw in the bootconstruction.  They should be glued at this part of the boot and a better thread used in case the stitching fails.Now I'm Bummed.  I ordered these on Dec 31, 2020 when the worst of winter was over.  This BITES.3rd Update: It's Oct 15,2021.  The patch I made with silicone held up where the thread came out.  These boots have taken a beating and my feet only got wet when snow or water came over the top.  They have worn like iron and we've just had 3 days of snow and mud.  It's all white and wet outside.  My feet are still dry and warm with just a pair of athletic socks.  I wore them in the summer when I had to be in wet pastures and my feet stayed dry.  The soles have help up tremendously well and so have the toes.  While they're heavier than some other boots out there, they have held up well.  I'm surprised they held up as well as they have.  The shank hasn't broken like they did in Danner boots and they have Keen boots beat by a mile.  Where the stitching came loose and I applied a small silicone patch, never got any worse.  One thing I did right at the start was use one entire can of silicone on  both boots as I do all my boots.  WHile not looking as good as some might like, they took a licking and I kept on kicking in them to get mud and such to release from the soles.  Best boots for durability I've had in a long time.  My feet did get some heat rash on them in the summer because they're sealed so well.  I can't believe I'm headed into another winter with them.""]"

You\'d just notice some texturing. When wet, however, it is another matter.Salomon. Please sell the insoles! It is a real issue.Update II:I decided to do a serious test to see just what is up with these insoles.Here\'s the test:1. I walk 0.3 miles.2. The elevation change is a mild 128 feet. 39.0144 meters.3. I repeat this walk up and then down 5 times.4. The walk is a total of roughly 600 steps.5. The heat is 91 F in the shade ( 32 C) and 110 F (43.3 C) sustained exposure to the sunlight.6. It\'s anywhere between 55% humidity to 63% humidity without any further deviation for weeks now.Results:After 1.2 miles (1.931) kilometers the ""wrinkle"" gets wet from sweat and/or rain and the insole deforms at the arch of the foot nearest the ball and big toe.- this is consistent after 3 days of testing.The insole without the wrinkle produces no issues.Walking with the insoles is possible so long as the climate remains dry and the humidity very low. In other words, the issue wouldn\'t likely exist in a climate like Arizona, but would be a real problem in a tropical or temperate region where the humidity is consistently higher. I am, unfortunately, in such a climate.Walking without the insoles is also possible, but so far as I have found REPLACING THEM is not possible. If there is a way to do this Salomon has gone out of their way to mask it with a fanciful website full of pretty images that never gets to the point... ""want insole, buy where?"". Thank you.In all else, the shoes are very good. The arch support is simply the best. I\'ve tried most of the less expensive brands up to Keens. Keens make good sandals, but I wouldn\'t even call their other shoes footware compared to these.Another thing with the insole... you can walk without it, but don\'t try replacing it other insoles. It doesn\'t work. These shoes are designed to support your feet, not have your feet supported. It\'s a very big difference in functionality. If you want to experience a lot of unnecessary pain and anguish though, do try other insoles. I speak from experience. I\'ve about about 14 different kinds trying to replace these so far. The pain is exquisite, but none of them work like the ortholite.

I have been wearing Asics for 20+ years, mostly the GT-2000 series and its predecessor.  I have noticed over the last couple of years that the GT-2000 series have not quite felt the same in quality and comfort.  I had recently checked out a professional reading blog comparing the GT-1000 and the GT-2000 series.  It actually made note that the GT-1000s actually felt a bit more like the older GT-2000s. So, I gave them a try.  They felt okay.  But I had also started looking at the Kayano\'s.  Amazon had a pair that was almost half off the original price in a decent color scheme, so I decided to give them a try.  Out of the box they were one of the most comfortable pairs of running shoes I have ever owned.

However, the stars have aligned and all is right in the world again.....the 28s emulate many of their successful predecessors. Enough of my sarcastic wit. Seriously, I would like to know if any of the shoe engineers at Asics are runners themselves or if they utilize focus groups before they unveil some of the more recent disasters. Regardless, the 28s are a keeper!', ""I've had a pair of Kayano 20's for a few years now which have held up great and provided solid cushioning for close to 1,000 miles of mostly sub-5 mile runs. I now have about 400 mi on the Kayano 28's and there is clearly significantly faster wear taking place on the traction sole of the shoe vs the 20s. Perhaps traction is better with the 28's and that is the tradeoff, though I never noticed an issue with traction with the 20's. Perhaps the 28's are more cheaply made, but if so, the savings have certainly not been passed onto the consumer, as the 28's were more expensive than the 20's. Overall I like the shoes, they are very comfortable and supportive. The fit is great (went with wide this time as the 20s put a bit too much pressure on my small toes at the same size, 12 1/2).

These are by far the best most comfortable boots I have ever had that are actually tough enough for work.  Now I have had boots that may have been as comfortable or maybe slightly more, but they just don't last at all.  These are freaking tough and feel great.  I can wear them all day at work and I am in no hurry to take them off when I get home like so many others.  When I am starting a new project I spend a lot of time kneeling on concrete laying out walls and other things, which destroys the toe of even the toughest boots, but the toe protection that is on this boot is pretty much bulletproof.  The thread on it that looks like a truck tire,  has been worn a little smooth in spots on mine from more than a year of use now, but it is still in great shape.  I love the and when the time does come for a new pair of boots, I will DEFINITELY be buying another pair of these."", ""I work in the food industry so was after a slip resistant and waterproof boot. Ideally would have wanted something chemical resistant as well, unfortunately these aren't listed as such. Although, it claims to be oil resistant.These are a joy to put on. The anti-fatigue sole really works. Feels like you are walking on pillows. Being summer in Australia at the moment, my feet do get a little warm if I am walking to and from site and on the street. But once at work. The insulation never feels too warm.Solid construction and feels like they will last awhile. Haven't spilt anything on them yet. So can't comment on how waterproof they are."", 'I work on industrial airline equipment. I‚Äôve had a pair of these boots for almost 2 years now. I owned a pair of carhartt boots prior to these and they only lasted me 6 months or so.  I‚Äôve stepped on burnt metals with these boots after using a torch, I‚Äôve had these boots covered in aircraft de-icing fluid, diesel, gas, oil, brake cleaner, and many other damaging chemicals. The boots are very warm in below zero temperatures. They are also the best waterproof boots I‚Äôve ever owned. I‚Äôve put these boots through hell and they have no major signs of wear other then the burn marks on the bottom side of the soles. These boots have good traction in snow and rain. The heel protection & composite toe on the boots are a life saver. The only honest down falls of these boots are the laces are trash, the sole inserts are trash so you‚Äôll have buy better ones or replace them around 6 months depending how much you use the boots and how much you are on your feet.']"

But, I\'ve worn enough Skechers to know how they fit. Even still, I bought try before you buy just in case. At any rate, these arrived and I tried them on. Very tight. Not too tight. And I knew they would give a bit. After wearing for a week, I can say they fit great and you would never know they are slip on shoes because they never slide up and down. I\'ve found them to be great for walking since the soles are nicely cushioned and thick! I prefer these to Skechers ""walking"" shoes even.', 'I could only rate what I was able to determine by ""examination"".  I normally wear a size 11E shoe, so I ordered the wide version.  It was wide all right - I probably had an extra quarter inch of space beside my foot and almost that much in front of my toes when I put the shoe on.  So I couldn\'t really rate them beyond what I could tell with a shoe that was far too big for me. Actually not only did I order the wrong size, I accidentally ordered the wrong shoe (I hate slip-ons - I want laces, or clasps, or rivets, or screws, or bolts, or ... well that\'s an exaggeration but you get the message... I want something that I can lace as tightly or loosely as I want.  But that\'s just me.)  I ordered a different Skecher which is very similar to this one except that it has laces and I like that pair a lot.However, I did have a talk with a neighbor who also wears a very similar Skecher shoe.  He has 3 pair of them, all for working on hard floors, and they are all the same size THEORETICALLY.  There seems to be a good deal of variation in size even in shoes of the same exact model and size.  So you need to be sure to try them on and return them for a better fit if that should happen to you.  They\'re good once you get a pair that fits well, and that\'s probably the most important factor to take away from my comment.I  would recommend these if you like slip-on\'s ... (I\'m just set in my ways and have had too many ""slip-ons"" slip OFF at unexpected times in the past, so I don\'t like them).', ""I have the worst time finding shoes that fit, and most shoe stores don't have shoes the fit well, feel comfortable, and have a reasonable price tag, so I was very pleased to find these. I love the fit, they are very comfortable, and I didn't have to spend a fortune to get exactly what I needed. The fit and quality are great, and I like the fact that it was so easy to order them, I didn't have to go to multiple stores or choose from a limited supply. Definitely going to be my go-to for buying shoes in the future.""]"
